## Topic Overview

C++20 range algorithms return **named structs** instead of single iterators. This is a deliberate upgrade - when an algorithm consumes part of a range, you often want to know where it stopped in *both* the input and the output, not just one of them. The named-struct return gives you all of that in one shot.

Here's the contrast that makes this click:

```cpp
// Old: std::copy returns just the output iterator
auto out = std::copy(v.begin(), v.end(), dest.begin());

// New: ranges::copy returns {in, out}
auto [in, out] = std::ranges::copy(v, dest.begin());
// 'in' = past-the-end of input, 'out' = past-the-end of output
```

With the old approach, if you wanted to keep iterating from where the input stopped, you had to track that yourself. With the new approach, both positions come back in one return value.

### Common Return Types

If the table feels like a lot, just remember the naming pattern: the fields are named after what they are (`in`, `out`, `in1`, `in2`, `min`, `max`, `fun`), so structured bindings always read clearly.

| Algorithm | Return Type | Fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ranges::copy` | `ranges::in_out_result` | `{in, out}` |
| `ranges::mismatch` | `ranges::in_in_result` | `{in1, in2}` |
| `ranges::min_max` | `ranges::min_max_result` | `{min, max}` |
| `ranges::partition` | `ranges::subrange` | iterator pair |
| `ranges::for_each` | `ranges::in_fun_result` | `{in, fun}` |

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Show that `ranges::copy` returns a `{in, out}` struct, not just the output iterator

The key thing to notice here is that the result has two named members, `.in` and `.out`, and both are usable for continued iteration.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <ranges>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> src = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    std::vector<int> dst(5);

    // ranges::copy returns ranges::in_out_result<InputIt, OutputIt>
    auto result = std::ranges::copy(src, dst.begin());

    // Structured bindings:
    auto [in_iter, out_iter] = result;

    std::cout << "Input consumed: " << (in_iter == src.end()) << "\n";  // true
    std::cout << "Output at end: " << (out_iter == dst.end()) << "\n";  // true

    // The struct has named members:
    std::cout << "result.in == src.end(): " << (result.in == src.end()) << "\n";
    std::cout << "result.out == dst.end(): " << (result.out == dst.end()) << "\n";

    // Compare with old std::copy - returns ONLY output iterator:
    auto old_result = std::copy(src.begin(), src.end(), dst.begin());
    // old_result is just an iterator - no info about input position!

    std::cout << "\nCopied: ";
    for (int x : dst) std::cout << x << " ";
    std::cout << "\n";

    // ranges::copy_if also returns {in, out}:
    std::vector<int> evens;
    auto [in2, out2] = std::ranges::copy_if(src, std::back_inserter(evens),
        [](int x) { return x % 20 == 0; });
    std::cout << "Evens: ";
    for (int x : evens) std::cout << x << " ";
    std::cout << "\n";
}
// Expected output:
//   Input consumed: 1
//   Output at end: 1
//   result.in == src.end(): 1
//   result.out == dst.end(): 1
//
//   Copied: 10 20 30 40 50
//   Evens: 20 40
```

Both `.in` and `.out` are real iterators you can compare and dereference. The old `std::copy` gave you only `.out`, which meant you needed to track the input position yourself if you ever wanted to continue from it.

---

### Q2: Use structured bindings to continue iteration after `ranges::copy`

This is where the structured return types really pay off. Because `copy_n` tells you where the input stopped, you can immediately hand that position to the next operation without any manual bookkeeping.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <ranges>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> data = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
    std::vector<int> first_half(5);
    std::vector<int> second_half(5);

    // Copy first 5 elements:
    auto [mid, out1] = std::ranges::copy_n(data.begin(), 5, first_half.begin());

    // 'mid' points to element 6 in data - continue from there!
    auto [end, out2] = std::ranges::copy(mid, data.end(), second_half.begin());

    std::cout << "First half: ";
    for (int x : first_half) std::cout << x << " ";
    std::cout << "\nSecond half: ";
    for (int x : second_half) std::cout << x << " ";
    std::cout << "\n";

    // Another example: ranges::mismatch returns {in1, in2}
    std::vector<int> a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::vector<int> b = {1, 2, 9, 4, 5};

    auto [it_a, it_b] = std::ranges::mismatch(a, b);
    std::cout << "\nFirst mismatch at index " << (it_a - a.begin())
              << ": " << *it_a << " vs " << *it_b << "\n";

    // Continue comparing from where mismatch stopped:
    auto [it_a2, it_b2] = std::ranges::mismatch(it_a + 1, a.end(), it_b + 1, b.end());
    std::cout << "Next mismatch: " << (it_a2 == a.end() ? "none" : "found") << "\n";
}
// Expected output:
//   First half: 1 2 3 4 5
//   Second half: 6 7 8 9 10
//
//   First mismatch at index 2: 3 vs 9
//   Next mismatch: none
```

Notice that `mid` from the first `copy_n` feeds directly into the second `copy`. No extra arithmetic or offset calculation needed - the algorithm hands you exactly the iterator to use next.

### Q3: Explain why the new return types are more informative than old iterator-only returns

The comparison at the end of this example sums it up nicely. The old `pair<It, It>` approach gave you two iterators with no hint about what they meant. The new named struct tells you what each field is - `.in`, `.out`, `.fun` - so the code reads clearly without you having to remember which position is `.first` and which is `.second`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <ranges>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> v = {5, 3, 8, 1, 9, 2, 7};

    // OLD: std::minmax_element returns pair<It, It>
    auto [old_min, old_max] = std::minmax_element(v.begin(), v.end());
    std::cout << "Old: min=" << *old_min << " max=" << *old_max << "\n";

    // NEW: ranges::minmax returns min_max_result{min, max} (values!)
    auto [min_val, max_val] = std::ranges::minmax(v);
    std::cout << "New: min=" << min_val << " max=" << max_val << "\n";

    // ranges::for_each returns {in, fun} - preserves stateful functors
    struct Summer {
        int total = 0;
        void operator()(int x) { total += x; }
    };

    auto [end_it, summer] = std::ranges::for_each(v, Summer{});
    std::cout << "Sum: " << summer.total << "\n";
    // Old for_each: returns the functor but NOT the iterator position

    // ranges::partition returns a subrange of the second partition
    auto second_part = std::ranges::partition(v, [](int x) { return x < 5; });
    std::cout << "Partition point at index: " << (second_part.begin() - v.begin()) << "\n";
    std::cout << "Second partition: ";
    for (int x : second_part) std::cout << x << " ";
    std::cout << "\n";
}
// Expected output:
//   Old: min=1 max=9
//   New: min=1 max=9
//   Sum: 35
//   Partition point at index: 3
//   Second partition: 5 9 8 7  (or similar, order depends on partition)
```

The `for_each` case is especially useful: the old version returned only the functor, so if you wanted to know the final iterator position you had to track it separately. The new `{in, fun}` return gives you both with zero extra work.

**Why structured returns are better:**

| Old (iterator-pair) | New (named struct) |
| --- | --- |
| `pair<It, It>` - `.first` / `.second` | `{.in1, .in2}` - named fields |
| No info about input consumption | `{.in, .out}` - both positions |
| Stateful functors discarded | `{.in, .fun}` - functor returned |
| `pair<T, T>` is generic | `min_max_result<T>` is self-documenting |

## Notes

- **Implicit conversion:** Result types convert to `std::pair` and `std::tuple` for backward compatibility.
- **Structured bindings** (`auto [in, out] = ...`) are the idiomatic way to use these returns.
- **All range algorithms** return structured types - check cppreference for each algorithm's specific return type.
- **`ranges::subrange`** is returned by algorithms that produce a range (like `partition`, `remove`).
