## Topic Overview

### When to Use `noexcept`

If the table feels like a lot, the mental model is simple: mark `noexcept` whenever you can prove the function genuinely cannot throw, especially on operations that containers depend on for safety decisions.

| Mark `noexcept` | Don't mark `noexcept` |
| --- | --- |
| Move constructors/assignments | Functions that might throw |
| Swap functions | Functions with complex logic |
| Destructors (implicit already) | Virtual functions (may be overridden) |
| Leaf functions that can't throw | Functions calling unknown code |
| Comparison operators | Allocating functions (`new`, containers) |

### Why It Matters for Performance

Three concrete reasons:

1. **`std::vector` reallocation**: Uses `std::move_if_noexcept` - falls back to **copy** if move isn't `noexcept`.
2. **Compiler optimizations**: `noexcept` allows removing exception-handling code paths.
3. **Inlining**: No need to generate unwind tables for `noexcept` functions.

The first point is the one that bites people most often. If your move constructor is missing `noexcept`, every `std::vector` reallocation copies your objects instead of moving them - silently, with no warning.

### The Contract

`noexcept` is a hard contract: if a `noexcept` function throws, `std::terminate` is called immediately - no stack unwinding, no cleanup. This is intentional: the compiler can generate leaner code precisely because it doesn't need to plan for unwinding.

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Add `noexcept` to a move constructor and verify `std::vector` uses move instead of copy during reallocation

The difference is dramatic and invisible without instrumentation. Here you can see exactly which operation `std::vector` chooses based solely on whether the move constructor is `noexcept`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

// Widget WITH noexcept move -> vector will MOVE during reallocation
class SafeWidget {
    std::string name_;
public:
    SafeWidget(std::string n) : name_(std::move(n)) {}

    SafeWidget(SafeWidget&& other) noexcept  // <- noexcept!
        : name_(std::move(other.name_)) {
        std::cout << "  MOVE: " << name_ << "\n";
    }

    SafeWidget(const SafeWidget& other) : name_(other.name_) {
        std::cout << "  COPY: " << name_ << "\n";
    }

    SafeWidget& operator=(SafeWidget&&) noexcept = default;
};

// Widget WITHOUT noexcept move -> vector falls back to COPY
class UnsafeWidget {
    std::string name_;
public:
    UnsafeWidget(std::string n) : name_(std::move(n)) {}

    UnsafeWidget(UnsafeWidget&& other)  // <- NO noexcept!
        : name_(std::move(other.name_)) {
        std::cout << "  MOVE: " << name_ << "\n";
    }

    UnsafeWidget(const UnsafeWidget& other) : name_(other.name_) {
        std::cout << "  COPY: " << name_ << "\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    std::cout << "=== noexcept move -> vector uses MOVE ===\n";
    {
        std::vector<SafeWidget> v;
        v.reserve(2);
        v.emplace_back("A");
        v.emplace_back("B");
        std::cout << "  Reallocation triggered:\n";
        v.emplace_back("C");  // Capacity exceeded -> reallocation
        // A and B are MOVED (noexcept move available)
    }

    std::cout << "\n=== Non-noexcept move -> vector uses COPY ===\n";
    {
        std::vector<UnsafeWidget> v;
        v.reserve(2);
        v.emplace_back("A");
        v.emplace_back("B");
        std::cout << "  Reallocation triggered:\n";
        v.emplace_back("C");
        // A and B are COPIED (move might throw -> unsafe for strong guarantee)
    }

    // How vector decides internally:
    std::cout << "\n=== How std::vector decides ===\n";
    std::cout << "  std::move_if_noexcept(x) returns:\n";
    std::cout << "    T&& if T's move ctor is noexcept -> MOVE\n";
    std::cout << "    const T& if T's move ctor may throw -> COPY\n";
    std::cout << "  Reason: strong exception guarantee requires rollback\n";
    std::cout << "          if move throws mid-reallocation, elements are lost!\n";

    // Compile-time check
    std::cout << "\n  is_nothrow_move_constructible:\n";
    std::cout << "    SafeWidget:   " << std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<SafeWidget> << "\n";
    std::cout << "    UnsafeWidget: " << std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<UnsafeWidget> << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

Notice that `UnsafeWidget`'s move constructor does the same work as `SafeWidget`'s - it cannot actually throw. But the compiler doesn't know that without the `noexcept` keyword, so it conservatively falls back to copying.

### Q2: Explain how `noexcept` affects exception specification inheritance and virtual dispatch

Two rules govern how `noexcept` flows through inheritance. First, a derived override can add `noexcept` (tighten the contract) but cannot remove it (loosen the contract). Second, an implicitly-generated special member's `noexcept` status is the logical AND of all its sub-objects' `noexcept` status.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Rule: A derived class override can be MORE restrictive (add noexcept)
//       but CANNOT be LESS restrictive (remove noexcept from base).

class Base {
public:
    virtual ~Base() = default;

    // noexcept virtual function
    virtual void safe_op() noexcept {
        std::cout << "  Base::safe_op (noexcept)\n";
    }

    // Potentially throwing virtual function
    virtual void risky_op() {
        std::cout << "  Base::risky_op (may throw)\n";
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    // OK: Base is noexcept, Derived is also noexcept (matching)
    void safe_op() noexcept override {
        std::cout << "  Derived::safe_op (noexcept)\n";
    }

    // COMPILE ERROR if uncommented:
    // void safe_op() override {  // ERROR: looser exception spec
    //     throw std::runtime_error("oops");
    // }

    // OK: Base may throw, Derived promises noexcept (more restrictive)
    void risky_op() noexcept override {
        std::cout << "  Derived::risky_op (now noexcept)\n";
    }
};

// Exception specification inheritance:
// - Implicitly declared special members inherit noexcept from base/members
// - If all bases/members have noexcept move -> derived gets noexcept move

struct A { A(A&&) noexcept {} };
struct B { B(B&&) noexcept {} };
struct C : A {
    B member;
    // C(C&&) is implicitly noexcept (A move + B move are both noexcept)
};

struct D { D(D&&) {} };  // NOT noexcept
struct E : A {
    D member;
    // E(E&&) is implicitly NOT noexcept (D move may throw)
};

int main() {
    std::cout << "=== noexcept and Virtual Dispatch ===\n\n";

    Derived d;
    Base& b = d;

    b.safe_op();   // Calls Derived::safe_op (noexcept guarantee preserved)
    b.risky_op();  // Calls Derived::risky_op (now noexcept, but caller doesn't know)

    std::cout << "\n=== Exception Spec Inheritance ===\n";
    std::cout << "  C move noexcept: " << std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<C> << "\n";  // 1
    std::cout << "  E move noexcept: " << std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<E> << "\n";  // 0

    std::cout << "\n=== Rules ===\n";
    std::cout << "  1. Override can add noexcept (more restrictive) - OK\n";
    std::cout << "  2. Override cannot remove noexcept (less restrictive) - ERROR\n";
    std::cout << "  3. Implicit noexcept = AND of all sub-objects' noexcept\n";

    return 0;
}
```

The implication for struct `E` is important: even though `A`'s move is fine, adding one member (`D`) whose move isn't `noexcept` makes the whole struct's move potentially throwing. This is why you need to check the whole chain.

### Q3: Show that calling a `noexcept` function that throws invokes `std::terminate`

This is one of those "trust but verify" situations. The `noexcept` contract is enforced at runtime - if you break it, the program terminates immediately without any unwinding.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <exception>
#include <cstdlib>

// Custom terminate handler to prove it's called
void my_terminate() {
    std::cout << "  *** std::terminate called! ***\n";
    std::cout << "  No stack unwinding occurred.\n";
    std::cout << "  No catch blocks were checked.\n";
    std::abort();  // Must terminate the program
}

// A noexcept function that THROWS - this is undefined-ish behavior
// The standard says: std::terminate is called
void dangerous() noexcept {
    std::cout << "  In dangerous() - about to throw...\n";
    throw std::runtime_error("oops");
    // This throw WILL NOT propagate!
    // std::terminate is called IMMEDIATELY
}

int main() {
    // Install custom terminate handler
    std::set_terminate(my_terminate);

    std::cout << "=== noexcept + throw = std::terminate ===\n\n";

    try {
        std::cout << "Inside try block, calling dangerous()...\n";
        dangerous();
        std::cout << "After dangerous() - NEVER REACHED\n";
    }
    catch (const std::exception& e) {
        // This catch block is NEVER entered!
        std::cout << "Caught: " << e.what() << " - NEVER REACHED\n";
    }
    catch (...) {
        // This catch block is NEVER entered either!
        std::cout << "Caught unknown - NEVER REACHED\n";
    }

    std::cout << "After try/catch - NEVER REACHED\n";
    return 0;
}
// Expected output:
//   === noexcept + throw = std::terminate ===
//   Inside try block, calling dangerous()...
//   In dangerous() - about to throw...
//   *** std::terminate called! ***
//   No stack unwinding occurred.
//   No catch blocks were checked.
//   (program aborted)
//
// KEY: The exception does NOT propagate to any catch block.
// std::terminate is called before unwinding begins.
```

This is why you must not mark functions `noexcept` speculatively. If there is any code path that could throw, the `noexcept` promise is a lie waiting to terminate your program.

## Notes

- **Always** mark move constructors, move assignment, swap, and destructors `noexcept`.
- `noexcept` is part of the type system since C++17 - `void(*)() noexcept` is a different type from `void(*)()`.
- Use `noexcept(expr)` for conditional noexcept: `noexcept(noexcept(other_func()))`.
- Don't add `noexcept` to functions that might allocate memory - `new` can throw `bad_alloc`.
- Compiler flag `-Wnoexcept` (GCC) warns when `noexcept` would improve performance.
