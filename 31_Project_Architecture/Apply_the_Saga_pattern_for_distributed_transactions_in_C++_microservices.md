# Apply the Saga pattern for distributed transactions in C++ microservices

**Category:** Project Architecture

---

## Topic Overview

The **Saga pattern** manages distributed transactions across multiple services without a global lock. Each step executes a local transaction and publishes an event. If any step fails, **compensating transactions** undo the effects of previous steps in reverse order. There are two coordination approaches: **choreography** (event-driven, decentralized) and **orchestration** (centralized controller).

The reason this pattern exists is that classic ACID transactions across multiple independent services are either impossible or prohibitively expensive in a microservices world. You can not hold a database lock across an HTTP call to a payment processor. The Saga pattern accepts this and instead builds correctness out of a chain of compensatable steps - if something goes wrong at step N, you roll back steps N-1, N-2, and so on by explicitly undoing each one.

### Choreography vs Orchestration

| Aspect | Choreography | Orchestration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coordination | Each service listens and reacts | Central orchestrator manages flow |
| Coupling | Looser (event-driven) | Services coupled to orchestrator |
| Complexity | Hard to trace full flow | Clear, centralized flow |
| Error handling | Distributed, harder | Centralized, easier |
| Best for | Simple sagas (2-3 steps) | Complex sagas (4+ steps) |

### Q1: Implement orchestration-based saga

**Answer:**

In the orchestration approach, a single `SagaOrchestrator` object drives the workflow. It knows the full list of steps and their compensating actions. When a step fails, it walks backward through the already-completed steps and compensates each one in reverse order:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <functional>
#include <optional>
#include <variant>
#include <iostream>

// === Saga step: action + compensating action ===
struct SagaStep {
    std::string name;
    std::function<bool()> execute;      // Returns true on success
    std::function<void()> compensate;   // Undo on failure
};

// === Saga orchestrator ===
class SagaOrchestrator {
public:
    enum class Status { NotStarted, Running, Completed, Compensating, Failed };

    void add_step(SagaStep step) {
        steps_.push_back(std::move(step));
    }

    Status execute() {
        status_ = Status::Running;
        completed_steps_ = 0;

        for (size_t i = 0; i < steps_.size(); ++i) {
            std::cout << "Executing step: " << steps_[i].name << "\n";

            if (!steps_[i].execute()) {
                std::cout << "Step failed: " << steps_[i].name
                          << ", compensating...\n";
                compensate(i);
                status_ = Status::Failed;
                return status_;
            }
            completed_steps_ = i + 1;
        }

        status_ = Status::Completed;
        return status_;
    }

private:
    void compensate(size_t failed_step) {
        status_ = Status::Compensating;
        // Compensate in reverse order, EXCLUDING the failed step
        for (int i = static_cast<int>(failed_step) - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            std::cout << "Compensating step: " << steps_[i].name << "\n";
            try {
                steps_[i].compensate();
            } catch (const std::exception& e) {
                // Log but continue compensating remaining steps
                std::cerr << "Compensation failed for "
                          << steps_[i].name << ": " << e.what() << "\n";
            }
        }
    }

    std::vector<SagaStep> steps_;
    Status status_ = Status::NotStarted;
    size_t completed_steps_ = 0;
};

// === Order creation saga ===
SagaOrchestrator create_order_saga(
    OrderService& orders, PaymentService& payments,
    InventoryService& inventory, ShippingService& shipping,
    const OrderRequest& request) {

    SagaOrchestrator saga;
    std::string order_id, payment_id, reservation_id;

    saga.add_step({
        "Create Order",
        [&]() {
            order_id = orders.create(request);
            return !order_id.empty();
        },
        [&]() { orders.cancel(order_id); }
    });

    saga.add_step({
        "Reserve Inventory",
        [&]() {
            reservation_id = inventory.reserve(request.items);
            return !reservation_id.empty();
        },
        [&]() { inventory.release(reservation_id); }
    });

    saga.add_step({
        "Process Payment",
        [&]() {
            payment_id = payments.charge(request.customer_id,
                                         request.total);
            return !payment_id.empty();
        },
        [&]() { payments.refund(payment_id); }
    });

    saga.add_step({
        "Schedule Shipping",
        [&]() {
            return shipping.schedule(order_id, request.address);
        },
        [&]() { shipping.cancel(order_id); }
    });

    return saga;
}

// Usage:
// auto saga = create_order_saga(orders, payments, inventory, shipping, req);
// auto status = saga.execute();
// If payment fails -> inventory released, order cancelled (reverse order)
```

The important detail is that compensation excludes the failed step itself - you do not try to undo something that never succeeded. You only walk back the steps that already ran successfully.

### Q2: Implement choreography-based saga with events

**Answer:**

In choreography, there is no central orchestrator. Each service listens for specific events and reacts by doing its job and publishing the next event. The saga "flow" emerges from the chain of event reactions. This feels more loosely coupled, but it can be hard to reason about because the flow is implicit:

```cpp
// === Choreography: each service reacts to events ===

// Events
struct OrderCreated { std::string order_id; OrderDetails details; };
struct InventoryReserved { std::string order_id; std::string reservation_id; };
struct InventoryFailed { std::string order_id; std::string reason; };
struct PaymentProcessed { std::string order_id; std::string payment_id; };
struct PaymentFailed { std::string order_id; std::string reason; };
struct OrderCompleted { std::string order_id; };
struct OrderCancelled { std::string order_id; std::string reason; };

// Inventory service listens for OrderCreated
class InventoryService {
public:
    explicit InventoryService(EventBus& bus) : bus_(bus) {
        bus.subscribe<OrderCreated>([this](const OrderCreated& e) {
            try {
                auto res_id = reserve(e.details.items);
                bus_.publish(InventoryReserved{e.order_id, res_id});
            } catch (...) {
                bus_.publish(InventoryFailed{e.order_id, "Out of stock"});
            }
        });

        // Compensate if payment fails
        bus.subscribe<PaymentFailed>([this](const PaymentFailed& e) {
            release_for_order(e.order_id);
        });
    }
    // ...
private:
    EventBus& bus_;
};

// Payment service listens for InventoryReserved
class PaymentService {
public:
    explicit PaymentService(EventBus& bus) : bus_(bus) {
        bus.subscribe<InventoryReserved>([this](const InventoryReserved& e) {
            try {
                auto pay_id = charge(e.order_id);
                bus_.publish(PaymentProcessed{e.order_id, pay_id});
            } catch (...) {
                bus_.publish(PaymentFailed{e.order_id, "Insufficient funds"});
            }
        });
    }
private:
    EventBus& bus_;
};

// Order service listens for completion/failure
class OrderService {
public:
    explicit OrderService(EventBus& bus) : bus_(bus) {
        bus.subscribe<PaymentProcessed>([this](const PaymentProcessed& e) {
            complete_order(e.order_id);
            bus_.publish(OrderCompleted{e.order_id});
        });

        bus.subscribe<InventoryFailed>([this](const InventoryFailed& e) {
            cancel_order(e.order_id, e.reason);
        });

        bus.subscribe<PaymentFailed>([this](const PaymentFailed& e) {
            cancel_order(e.order_id, e.reason);
        });
    }
private:
    EventBus& bus_;
};
```

Each service only knows about the events immediately before and after it in the chain. `PaymentService` has no idea that inventory was involved - it just reacts to `InventoryReserved`. The saga is the emergent behaviour of all these reactions together.

### Q3: Saga with timeout, retry, and idempotency

**Answer:**

A production saga needs to handle transient failures gracefully. Network calls time out, services are briefly unavailable, and messages can be delivered more than once. Here is a resilient orchestrator that adds retry logic, timeouts, and idempotency guards:

```cpp
// === Production-grade saga step with retry and timeout ===
struct ResilientSagaStep {
    std::string name;
    std::function<bool()> execute;
    std::function<void()> compensate;
    int max_retries = 3;
    std::chrono::milliseconds timeout{5000};
    std::chrono::milliseconds retry_delay{1000};
};

class ResilientSagaOrchestrator {
public:
    void add_step(ResilientSagaStep step) {
        steps_.push_back(std::move(step));
    }

    bool execute() {
        for (size_t i = 0; i < steps_.size(); ++i) {
            if (!execute_with_retry(steps_[i])) {
                compensate(i);
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

private:
    bool execute_with_retry(const ResilientSagaStep& step) {
        for (int attempt = 0; attempt <= step.max_retries; ++attempt) {
            if (attempt > 0) {
                std::cout << "Retry " << attempt << "/"
                          << step.max_retries << ": "
                          << step.name << "\n";
                std::this_thread::sleep_for(step.retry_delay * attempt);
            }

            // Execute with timeout
            auto future = std::async(std::launch::async, step.execute);
            if (future.wait_for(step.timeout) == std::future_status::ready) {
                if (future.get()) return true;  // Success
            } else {
                std::cerr << "Timeout: " << step.name << "\n";
            }
        }
        return false;  // All retries exhausted
    }

    void compensate(size_t failed_step) {
        for (int i = static_cast<int>(failed_step) - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            // Compensations also retry
            for (int attempt = 0; attempt <= 3; ++attempt) {
                try {
                    steps_[i].compensate();
                    break;  // Success
                } catch (...) {
                    if (attempt == 3) {
                        // Dead letter: manual intervention needed
                        log_dead_letter(steps_[i].name);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    std::vector<ResilientSagaStep> steps_;
};

// === Idempotency: prevent duplicate execution ===
class IdempotencyStore {
public:
    // Returns true if this is a new operation
    bool try_acquire(const std::string& idempotency_key) {
        std::lock_guard lock(mutex_);
        return completed_.insert(idempotency_key).second;
    }

    void release(const std::string& key) {
        std::lock_guard lock(mutex_);
        completed_.erase(key);
    }

private:
    std::mutex mutex_;
    std::unordered_set<std::string> completed_;
};

// Wrap step with idempotency
auto make_idempotent(IdempotencyStore& store, const std::string& key,
                     std::function<bool()> action) {
    return [&store, key, action]() -> bool {
        if (!store.try_acquire(key)) {
            return true;  // Already executed, consider success
        }
        return action();
    };
}
```

The `make_idempotent` wrapper is subtle but critical: if a message is delivered twice (a real risk in distributed systems), the second execution finds the key already present and returns success without doing the work again. Compensations need the same treatment - a compensation that runs twice should be safe.

---

## Notes

- Use **orchestration** for complex workflows; **choreography** for simple 2-3 step flows where the added traceability cost is not worth it.
- Compensating transactions must be **idempotent** - they may be called multiple times due to retries.
- Compensations that fail even after retries need a **dead letter queue** for manual resolution.
- Each saga step should be atomic at the local service level.
- Saga state must be persisted to survive crashes - store the step index and status in a database.
- Timeout plus retry is essential for cross-service calls; use exponential backoff to avoid hammering a struggling service.
- Sagas provide **eventual consistency**, not ACID - design your UIs to handle intermediate states gracefully.
