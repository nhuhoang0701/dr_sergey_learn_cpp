# Structure a C++ project with clean directory layout and CMake

**Category:** Project Architecture

---

## Topic Overview

A well-structured C++ project separates concerns into clear directories, uses modern CMake idioms, and scales gracefully from a small library to a large multi-component application. Getting the structure right from the start pays dividends: a new developer should be able to look at the top-level directory and immediately understand where things live, and the build system should enforce the same boundaries that the directory layout implies.

### Recommended Directory Structure

```cpp
my_project/
├── CMakeLists.txt              # Root build configuration
├── cmake/                      # CMake modules and toolchains
│   ├── CompilerWarnings.cmake
│   └── arm-toolchain.cmake
├── include/                    # Public headers (installed)
│   └── myproject/
│       ├── core.h
│       └── utils.h
├── src/                        # Implementation files
│   ├── core.cpp
│   ├── utils.cpp
│   └── internal/               # Private headers
│       └── detail.h
├── apps/                       # Executables
│   └── main.cpp
├── tests/                      # Test files
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   ├── test_core.cpp
│   └── test_utils.cpp
├── benchmarks/                 # Performance benchmarks
│   └── bench_core.cpp
├── docs/                       # Documentation
├── third_party/                # Vendored dependencies
├── .clang-tidy
├── .clang-format
└── vcpkg.json                  # Package dependencies
```

Notice that public headers live under `include/myproject/` with a subdirectory named after the project. That subdirectory is intentional - it prevents header name collisions when multiple libraries are in use. A consumer writes `#include <myproject/core.h>` rather than `#include <core.h>`, which is much less likely to clash with something else.

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Write a modern CMakeLists.txt for a library + application project

Modern CMake is all about targets and their properties rather than global variables. Every dependency relationship is expressed through `target_link_libraries` with visibility specifiers (`PUBLIC`, `PRIVATE`, `INTERFACE`), and include paths are attached to targets with generator expressions so the same target works correctly whether it is being built locally or consumed after installation.

**Answer:**

```cmake
# === Root CMakeLists.txt ===
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)
project(myproject
    VERSION 1.2.3
    DESCRIPTION "My awesome C++ project"
    LANGUAGES CXX
)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
set(CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS OFF)

# Generate compile_commands.json for IDE/tools
set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON)

# Options
option(BUILD_TESTING "Build tests" ON)
option(BUILD_BENCHMARKS "Build benchmarks" OFF)
option(BUILD_DOCS "Build documentation" OFF)

# Include custom CMake modules
list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake)
include(CompilerWarnings)

# === Library target ===
add_library(myproject_lib
    src/core.cpp
    src/utils.cpp
)
target_include_directories(myproject_lib
    PUBLIC
        $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include>
        $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include>
    PRIVATE
        ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/src/internal
)
add_library(myproject::lib ALIAS myproject_lib)
set_compiler_warnings(myproject_lib)

# === Application target ===
add_executable(myproject_app apps/main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(myproject_app PRIVATE myproject::lib)

# === Tests ===
if(BUILD_TESTING)
    enable_testing()
    add_subdirectory(tests)
endif()

# === Benchmarks ===
if(BUILD_BENCHMARKS)
    add_subdirectory(benchmarks)
endif()
```

```cmake
# === cmake/CompilerWarnings.cmake ===
function(set_compiler_warnings target)
    target_compile_options(${target} PRIVATE
        $<$<CXX_COMPILER_ID:GNU,Clang>:
            -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic
            -Wshadow -Wnon-virtual-dtor
            -Wconversion -Wsign-conversion
            -Woverloaded-virtual
        >
        $<$<CXX_COMPILER_ID:MSVC>:
            /W4 /permissive-
        >
    )
endfunction()
```

```cmake
# === tests/CMakeLists.txt ===
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
    googletest
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/google/googletest.git
    GIT_TAG v1.14.0
)
set(INSTALL_GTEST OFF CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

add_executable(myproject_tests
    test_core.cpp
    test_utils.cpp
)
target_link_libraries(myproject_tests
    PRIVATE myproject::lib GTest::gtest_main GTest::gmock
)
add_test(NAME myproject_tests COMMAND myproject_tests)
```

The generator expression `$<BUILD_INTERFACE:...>` vs `$<INSTALL_INTERFACE:...>` on the include directories is easy to miss but important. During a local build, the includes should point to the source tree. After installation, they should point to wherever headers were installed on the system. If you omit this and just use a raw path, the installed package will have broken includes pointing at your dev machine's source directory.

### Q2: Configure installation and find_package support

When you want other CMake projects to consume your library via `find_package`, you need to install a small set of CMake config files alongside the headers and binaries. This is what makes `find_package(myproject REQUIRED)` work.

**Answer:**

```cmake
# === Install rules (append to root CMakeLists.txt) ===
include(GNUInstallDirs)
include(CMakePackageConfigHelpers)

# Install library
install(TARGETS myproject_lib
    EXPORT myprojectTargets
    LIBRARY DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}
    ARCHIVE DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}
    RUNTIME DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR}
)

# Install headers
install(DIRECTORY include/myproject
    DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR}
)

# Install CMake config for find_package
install(EXPORT myprojectTargets
    FILE myprojectTargets.cmake
    NAMESPACE myproject::
    DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}/cmake/myproject
)

configure_package_config_file(
    cmake/myprojectConfig.cmake.in
    ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/myprojectConfig.cmake
    INSTALL_DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}/cmake/myproject
)

write_basic_package_version_file(
    ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/myprojectConfigVersion.cmake
    VERSION ${PROJECT_VERSION}
    COMPATIBILITY SameMajorVersion
)

install(FILES
    ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/myprojectConfig.cmake
    ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/myprojectConfigVersion.cmake
    DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}/cmake/myproject
)
```

```cmake
# === cmake/myprojectConfig.cmake.in ===
@PACKAGE_INIT@
include("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/myprojectTargets.cmake")
check_required_components(myproject)
```

```cmake
# Consumers can now use:
# find_package(myproject 1.2 REQUIRED)
# target_link_libraries(myapp PRIVATE myproject::lib)
```

The `SameMajorVersion` compatibility mode means a consumer asking for version 1.2 will accept 1.3 or 1.5, but not 2.0. That is the standard semver promise: minor versions are backward compatible within a major version.

### Q3: CMake presets for different build configurations

`CMakePresets.json` replaces the old habit of writing shell scripts that set dozens of `-D` flags before calling CMake. Every developer on the team and every CI pipeline uses the exact same preset names, and the configuration is checked into source control.

**Answer:**

```json
{
    "version": 6,
    "cmakeMinimumRequired": {"major": 3, "minor": 25, "patch": 0},
    "configurePresets": [
        {
            "name": "dev",
            "displayName": "Development",
            "binaryDir": "${sourceDir}/build/dev",
            "cacheVariables": {
                "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE": "Debug",
                "BUILD_TESTING": "ON",
                "CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS": "ON"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "release",
            "displayName": "Release",
            "binaryDir": "${sourceDir}/build/release",
            "cacheVariables": {
                "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE": "Release",
                "BUILD_TESTING": "OFF"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "ci",
            "displayName": "CI Build",
            "binaryDir": "${sourceDir}/build/ci",
            "cacheVariables": {
                "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE": "Release",
                "BUILD_TESTING": "ON",
                "BUILD_BENCHMARKS": "ON"
            }
        }
    ],
    "buildPresets": [
        {"name": "dev", "configurePreset": "dev"},
        {"name": "release", "configurePreset": "release"},
        {"name": "ci", "configurePreset": "ci"}
    ],
    "testPresets": [
        {
            "name": "dev",
            "configurePreset": "dev",
            "output": {"outputOnFailure": true}
        }
    ]
}
```

```bash
# Usage:
cmake --preset dev
cmake --build --preset dev
ctest --preset dev
```

Three commands and you are done. No flags to remember, no per-developer scripts to maintain.

## Notes

- Public headers go in `include/projectname/` - the subdirectory prevents include collisions.
- Use `$<BUILD_INTERFACE:...>` and `$<INSTALL_INTERFACE:...>` for correct include paths in both local and installed usage.
- Always use `ALIAS` targets (`myproject::lib`) - they fail loudly if the target doesn't exist.
- `cmake/` directory holds toolchains, find modules, and helper functions.
- CMakePresets.json replaces the need for wrapper scripts - `cmake --preset dev` is all you need.
- `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON` is essential for clang-tidy and IDE support.
- Separate `apps/` from `src/` to keep library code reusable without the main() entry point.
