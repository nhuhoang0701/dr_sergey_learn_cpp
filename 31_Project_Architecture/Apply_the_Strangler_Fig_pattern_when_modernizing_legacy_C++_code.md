# Apply the Strangler Fig pattern when modernizing legacy C++ code

**Category:** Project Architecture

---

## Topic Overview

The **Strangler Fig pattern** incrementally replaces a legacy system by routing new functionality through a modern implementation while keeping the old system running. Named after strangler fig trees that grow around a host tree, it avoids risky "big bang" rewrites. In C++ this applies to migrating from C-style code to modern C++, replacing monoliths with modular architectures, or upgrading from C++98 to C++20.

The reason big bang rewrites fail so often is that you lose the ability to validate your work at every step. You write the new system for months, then flip the switch, and discover thousands of subtle behavioral differences. The Strangler Fig pattern lets you move one feature at a time. The old system keeps running. Every migration step can be independently deployed and rolled back. You never bet the whole business on one release.

### Migration Strategies Compared

| Strategy | Risk | Duration | Downtime | Legacy Runs? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Big bang rewrite** | Very high | Long | Extended | No (replaced) |
| **Strangler Fig** | Low | Gradual | Zero | Yes (shrinks) |
| **Branch by abstraction** | Medium | Medium | Zero | Partially |
| **Feature toggle** | Low | Gradual | Zero | Both run |

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Implement a facade to route between legacy and modern implementations

**Answer:**

The facade is the heart of the pattern. All callers use the facade's interface - they never call the legacy or modern code directly. Inside the facade, a set of feature flags controls which path is active for each operation. You migrate one feature at a time by calling `enable_modern`:

```cpp
#include <memory>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>

// === Legacy system (C-style, global state) ===
namespace legacy {
    struct order_t {
        int id;
        char customer[64];
        double total;
        int status;  // 0=pending, 1=shipped, 2=cancelled
    };

    int create_order(const char* customer, double total);
    int cancel_order(int order_id);
    order_t* get_order(int id);  // Returns raw pointer to static storage
}

// === Modern replacement ===
namespace modern {
    class Order {
    public:
        enum class Status { Pending, Shipped, Cancelled };
        std::string id;
        std::string customer;
        double total;
        Status status = Status::Pending;
    };

    class OrderService {
    public:
        std::string create(const std::string& customer, double total);
        void cancel(const std::string& id);
        std::optional<Order> find(const std::string& id);
    };
}

// === Strangler facade: routes to legacy or modern ===
class OrderFacade {
public:
    OrderFacade(modern::OrderService& modern_svc)
        : modern_(modern_svc) {}

    // Route based on feature completion
    std::string create_order(const std::string& customer, double total) {
        if (use_modern("create_order")) {
            return modern_.create(customer, total);
        }
        // Legacy path (adapter)
        int id = legacy::create_order(customer.c_str(), total);
        return std::to_string(id);
    }

    void cancel_order(const std::string& id) {
        if (use_modern("cancel_order")) {
            modern_.cancel(id);
        } else {
            legacy::cancel_order(std::stoi(id));
        }
    }

    // Gradually migrate features
    void enable_modern(const std::string& feature) {
        modern_features_.insert(feature);
        std::cout << "Migrated to modern: " << feature << "\n";
    }

private:
    bool use_modern(const std::string& feature) const {
        return modern_features_.count(feature) > 0;
    }

    modern::OrderService& modern_;
    std::unordered_set<std::string> modern_features_;
};

// === Gradual migration timeline ===
// Week 1: facade.enable_modern("create_order");
// Week 3: facade.enable_modern("cancel_order");
// Week 6: facade.enable_modern("get_order");
// Week 8: Remove legacy code entirely
```

The commented timeline at the bottom is not decoration - it is how you should plan and communicate the migration. Each week is an independently deployable change with a clear rollback path.

### Q2: Implement data migration with dual-write

**Answer:**

Feature routing is only half the problem. You also need the data to follow. Dual-write means every write goes to both systems during a transition period. Initially legacy is the primary (source of truth) and modern is best-effort. Once you have validated the modern store, you flip which one is primary:

```cpp
// === Dual-write: both systems receive writes during migration ===
class DualWriteOrderService {
public:
    DualWriteOrderService(legacy::Database& old_db,
                          modern::Database& new_db)
        : old_db_(old_db), new_db_(new_db) {}

    std::string create_order(const OrderRequest& req) {
        // Write to legacy (primary)
        int legacy_id = old_db_.insert_order(req);

        // Write to modern (secondary, best-effort during migration)
        try {
            auto modern_id = new_db_.insert_order(req, legacy_id);
            id_mapping_[legacy_id] = modern_id;
        } catch (const std::exception& e) {
            log_migration_error("create", legacy_id, e.what());
            // Don't fail the operation; legacy is still primary
        }

        return std::to_string(legacy_id);
    }

    // Phase 2: Modern becomes primary, legacy is secondary
    std::string create_order_v2(const OrderRequest& req) {
        auto modern_id = new_db_.insert_order(req);

        // Write to legacy (secondary, for rollback safety)
        try {
            old_db_.insert_order(req);
        } catch (...) {
            // Legacy write failure is non-fatal
        }

        return modern_id;
    }

    // Phase 3: Modern only (legacy removed)
    std::string create_order_v3(const OrderRequest& req) {
        return new_db_.insert_order(req);
    }

private:
    legacy::Database& old_db_;
    modern::Database& new_db_;
    std::unordered_map<int, std::string> id_mapping_;
};

// === Data comparison tool: verify migration correctness ===
class MigrationVerifier {
public:
    struct Mismatch {
        std::string field;
        std::string legacy_value;
        std::string modern_value;
    };

    std::vector<Mismatch> compare(int legacy_id,
                                  const std::string& modern_id) {
        std::vector<Mismatch> mismatches;

        auto legacy_order = legacy_db_.get_order(legacy_id);
        auto modern_order = modern_db_.get_order(modern_id);

        if (legacy_order.total != modern_order.total) {
            mismatches.push_back({"total",
                std::to_string(legacy_order.total),
                std::to_string(modern_order.total)});
        }
        // ... compare other fields
        return mismatches;
    }

    void verify_all() {
        int mismatched = 0;
        for (auto& [old_id, new_id] : id_mapping_) {
            auto issues = compare(old_id, new_id);
            if (!issues.empty()) {
                ++mismatched;
                log_mismatches(old_id, issues);
            }
        }
        std::cout << "Verification: "
                  << id_mapping_.size() - mismatched
                  << "/" << id_mapping_.size()
                  << " records match\n";
    }
};
```

The `MigrationVerifier` is your confidence meter. Running it continuously during the dual-write phase tells you exactly how many records differ between legacy and modern. You do not flip to Phase 2 until that number is consistently zero.

### Q3: Branch by abstraction for internal module replacement

**Answer:**

When the thing you are replacing is an internal module rather than an external system, branch by abstraction is cleaner than a routing facade. You introduce an interface, wrap the legacy code behind it, build the modern implementation behind the same interface, and then swap them at the factory level. Shadow mode lets you run both side-by-side and compare results before committing:

```cpp
// === Branch by abstraction: introduce interface, swap implementation ===

// Step 1: Extract interface from legacy code
class IPaymentProcessor {
public:
    virtual ~IPaymentProcessor() = default;
    virtual PaymentResult charge(const std::string& account,
                                  double amount) = 0;
    virtual PaymentResult refund(const std::string& transaction_id) = 0;
};

// Step 2: Wrap legacy behind the interface
class LegacyPaymentAdapter : public IPaymentProcessor {
public:
    PaymentResult charge(const std::string& account, double amount) override {
        // Legacy C-style call
        int result = legacy_charge_account(account.c_str(),
                                           (int)(amount * 100));
        return result == 0 ? PaymentResult::Success
                           : PaymentResult::Failed;
    }

    PaymentResult refund(const std::string& txn_id) override {
        return legacy_refund(std::stoi(txn_id)) == 0
            ? PaymentResult::Success
            : PaymentResult::Failed;
    }
};

// Step 3: Build modern implementation behind same interface
class ModernPaymentProcessor : public IPaymentProcessor {
public:
    PaymentResult charge(const std::string& account, double amount) override {
        auto txn = gateway_.create_transaction(account, amount);
        return txn.execute();
    }

    PaymentResult refund(const std::string& txn_id) override {
        return gateway_.refund(txn_id);
    }

private:
    PaymentGateway gateway_;
};

// Step 4: Toggle between implementations
class PaymentProcessorFactory {
public:
    static std::unique_ptr<IPaymentProcessor> create(Config& config) {
        if (config.get_bool("payments.use_modern")) {
            return std::make_unique<ModernPaymentProcessor>();
        }
        return std::make_unique<LegacyPaymentAdapter>();
    }
};

// Step 5: Shadow mode - run both, compare results
class ShadowPaymentProcessor : public IPaymentProcessor {
public:
    ShadowPaymentProcessor(
        std::unique_ptr<IPaymentProcessor> primary,
        std::unique_ptr<IPaymentProcessor> shadow)
        : primary_(std::move(primary)), shadow_(std::move(shadow)) {}

    PaymentResult charge(const std::string& account, double amount) override {
        auto primary_result = primary_->charge(account, amount);

        // Shadow execution: compare but don't affect result
        try {
            auto shadow_result = shadow_->charge(account, amount);
            if (shadow_result != primary_result) {
                log_shadow_mismatch("charge", primary_result,
                                     shadow_result);
            }
        } catch (...) {
            log_shadow_error("charge");
        }

        return primary_result;  // Always return primary's result
    }

private:
    std::unique_ptr<IPaymentProcessor> primary_;
    std::unique_ptr<IPaymentProcessor> shadow_;
};
```

Shadow mode is particularly powerful: the production result always comes from the primary implementation, so customers never see a difference. But the shadow is running in parallel and any divergence gets logged. Once the shadow log is clean over a meaningful sample of real transactions, you know it is safe to make the modern implementation the primary.

## Notes

- **Never do a big bang rewrite** of a working system - the Strangler Fig pattern is always safer and usually faster overall.
- The facade is the key abstraction: all consumers use it and are unaware of which implementation is active.
- **Dual-write** ensures data parity during migration; verify continuously with comparison tools.
- **Shadow mode** runs both implementations side-by-side and compares results before you commit to the switch.
- Feature flags control the route: percentage rollouts (5% modern -> 50% -> 100%) let you catch problems early.
- Each migration phase should be independently deployable and rollback-safe.
- Keep legacy tests green throughout - they are your behavioral specification for the new implementation.
