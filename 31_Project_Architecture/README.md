## Notes

- Separate interface from implementation - use abstract classes, Pimpl, or modules.
- Layer your architecture: platform -> core -> services -> application -> UI.
- Keep compile-time dependencies minimal - forward-declare types in headers when possible.
- Use dependency injection to make components testable and decoupled.
- The SOLID principles guide class design; GRASP patterns guide responsibility assignment.
- Monorepo vs multirepo is a build/CI decision - use Conan/vcpkg for library management.
- Define clear module boundaries - each library should have a single responsibility.
- Document architectural decisions (ADRs) - future developers need to understand the why.
- Use static libraries for internal code and shared libraries for plugin architectures.
- Configuration should be externalized (files, environment) - not hardcoded in source.
