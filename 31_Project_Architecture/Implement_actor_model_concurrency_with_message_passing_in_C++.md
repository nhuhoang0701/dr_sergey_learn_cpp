# Implement actor model concurrency with message passing in C++

**Category:** Project Architecture

---

## Topic Overview

The **Actor Model** treats concurrent entities as isolated actors that communicate exclusively through asynchronous message passing. Each actor has a mailbox (message queue), processes messages sequentially, and can create child actors or send messages to other actors. This eliminates shared mutable state and the need for locks entirely.

Here's the core insight that makes the actor model attractive: most concurrency bugs come from two threads touching the same data at the same time. The actor model eliminates that problem by design - each actor's data is private and only modified by that actor's own message-processing loop. Other actors can't reach in and modify it; they can only send a message asking the actor to do something. No shared state means no data races, and no locks means no deadlocks.

### Actor Model vs Shared-State Concurrency

| Aspect | Actor Model | Shared State + Locks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data sharing | None (message copies) | Shared memory + mutexes |
| Deadlocks | Impossible (no locks) | Common (lock ordering) |
| Data races | Impossible | Require careful locking |
| Debugging | Trace messages | Reproduce timing |
| Overhead | Message copies, queues | Lock contention |
| Best for | I/O-heavy, distributed | CPU-intensive, low-latency |

### Q1: Implement a basic actor framework

The actor base class here owns its own thread (`std::jthread`) and message queue (`std::queue<Message>` protected by a mutex and condition variable). When you call `send()`, you push a message into the mailbox and wake the actor's thread. The thread runs `run_loop()`, picks up messages one at a time, and calls `on_receive()`. Because `on_receive()` is called sequentially - one message at a time, never concurrently - subclasses can manipulate their internal state freely without any locking.

The `ActorSystem` class is a simple lifetime manager: it spawns actors (constructs them and calls `start()`) and shuts them all down on destruction.

**Answer:**

```cpp
#include <any>
#include <functional>
#include <memory>
#include <queue>
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>
#include <thread>
#include <unordered_map>

class Actor;
using ActorRef = std::shared_ptr<Actor>;

// === Message ===
struct Message {
    ActorRef sender;
    std::any payload;
};

// === Actor base class ===
class Actor : public std::enable_shared_from_this<Actor> {
public:
    virtual ~Actor() { stop(); }

    // Send message to this actor
    void send(Message msg) {
        {
            std::lock_guard lock(mutex_);
            mailbox_.push(std::move(msg));
        }
        cv_.notify_one();
    }

    // Convenience: send typed payload
    template<typename T>
    void tell(const T& payload, ActorRef sender = nullptr) {
        send({sender, std::any(payload)});
    }

    void start() {
        running_ = true;
        thread_ = std::jthread([this] { run_loop(); });
    }

    void stop() {
        {
            std::lock_guard lock(mutex_);
            running_ = false;
        }
        cv_.notify_all();
        if (thread_.joinable()) thread_.join();
    }

protected:
    // Override to handle messages
    virtual void on_receive(const Message& msg) = 0;

private:
    void run_loop() {
        while (true) {
            Message msg;
            {
                std::unique_lock lock(mutex_);
                cv_.wait(lock, [this] {
                    return !mailbox_.empty() || !running_;
                });
                if (!running_ && mailbox_.empty()) break;
                msg = std::move(mailbox_.front());
                mailbox_.pop();
            }
            on_receive(msg);  // Sequential processing = no races
        }
    }

    std::queue<Message> mailbox_;
    std::mutex mutex_;
    std::condition_variable cv_;
    std::jthread thread_;
    bool running_ = false;
};

// === Actor System: manages actor lifecycle ===
class ActorSystem {
public:
    template<typename ActorType, typename... Args>
    ActorRef spawn(Args&&... args) {
        auto actor = std::make_shared<ActorType>(std::forward<Args>(args)...);
        actor->start();
        actors_.push_back(actor);
        return actor;
    }

    void shutdown() {
        for (auto& a : actors_) a->stop();
        actors_.clear();
    }

private:
    std::vector<ActorRef> actors_;
};
```

The `std::any payload` in `Message` is what allows type-erased message dispatch. Each `on_receive` implementation does `std::any_cast<MyMessageType>(&msg.payload)` and checks for null to handle different message types. It's a lightweight dynamic dispatch mechanism without needing a full virtual message hierarchy.

### Q2: Build concrete actors that communicate via messages

Here's how a real-world scenario looks: an order processing pipeline with three actors. The `LoggerActor` is the simplest - it just prints log messages. The `PaymentActor` processes orders and replies to the sender. The `OrderActor` orchestrates: it forwards orders to payment and handles the response.

Notice how the `PaymentActor` sends its reply back using `msg.sender->tell(...)`. The sender reference is carried in the `Message` itself, so actors don't need hardcoded references to every actor they might reply to. This is a common actor pattern.

**Answer:**

```cpp
// === Message types ===
struct ProcessOrder { int order_id; double amount; };
struct OrderProcessed { int order_id; bool success; };
struct LogMessage { std::string text; };

// === Logger Actor ===
class LoggerActor : public Actor {
protected:
    void on_receive(const Message& msg) override {
        if (auto* log = std::any_cast<LogMessage>(&msg.payload)) {
            std::cout << "[LOG] " << log->text << "\n";
        }
    }
};

// === Payment Actor ===
class PaymentActor : public Actor {
public:
    explicit PaymentActor(ActorRef logger) : logger_(logger) {}

protected:
    void on_receive(const Message& msg) override {
        if (auto* order = std::any_cast<ProcessOrder>(&msg.payload)) {
            logger_->tell(LogMessage{
                "Processing payment for order " +
                std::to_string(order->order_id)});

            bool success = order->amount < 10000;  // Business rule

            // Reply to sender
            if (msg.sender) {
                msg.sender->tell(
                    OrderProcessed{order->order_id, success},
                    shared_from_this());
            }
        }
    }

private:
    ActorRef logger_;
};

// === Order Actor: orchestrates ===
class OrderActor : public Actor {
public:
    OrderActor(ActorRef payment, ActorRef logger)
        : payment_(payment), logger_(logger) {}

protected:
    void on_receive(const Message& msg) override {
        if (auto* order = std::any_cast<ProcessOrder>(&msg.payload)) {
            logger_->tell(LogMessage{
                "New order " + std::to_string(order->order_id)});
            payment_->tell(*order, shared_from_this());
        }
        else if (auto* result = std::any_cast<OrderProcessed>(&msg.payload)) {
            auto status = result->success ? "succeeded" : "failed";
            logger_->tell(LogMessage{
                "Order " + std::to_string(result->order_id)
                + " " + status});
        }
    }

private:
    ActorRef payment_;
    ActorRef logger_;
};

// === Usage ===
int main() {
    ActorSystem system;
    auto logger  = system.spawn<LoggerActor>();
    auto payment = system.spawn<PaymentActor>(logger);
    auto orders  = system.spawn<OrderActor>(payment, logger);

    orders->tell(ProcessOrder{1, 99.99});
    orders->tell(ProcessOrder{2, 50000.00});

    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));
    system.shutdown();
}
```

The `sleep_for` at the end is the simplest way to wait for in-flight messages to be processed before shutdown, since we don't have a more structured "drain and stop" mechanism in this basic framework. A production implementation would use a barrier or completion future instead.

### Q3: Implement supervision and error recovery

Supervision is the actor model's answer to fault tolerance. Instead of each actor trying to handle every possible error, you establish a hierarchy: parent actors (supervisors) are responsible for deciding what to do when child actors fail. When a child's `handle()` throws, the `SupervisedActor` catches it and consults `decide()` to choose a strategy: restart the actor (reset its state and keep going), stop it entirely, or escalate the problem to *its* parent.

This mirrors how Erlang/Akka supervision trees work, and it's a powerful pattern for building resilient systems: failures are isolated, recovery logic is centralized, and the rest of the system keeps running.

**Answer:**

```cpp
// === Supervised actor: parent monitors children ===
class SupervisedActor : public Actor {
public:
    enum class Strategy { Restart, Stop, Escalate };

protected:
    void on_receive(const Message& msg) override {
        try {
            handle(msg);
        } catch (const std::exception& e) {
            auto strategy = decide(e);
            switch (strategy) {
                case Strategy::Restart:
                    on_restart();
                    break;
                case Strategy::Stop:
                    stop();
                    break;
                case Strategy::Escalate:
                    if (parent_)
                        parent_->tell(
                            ChildFailed{shared_from_this(), e.what()});
                    break;
            }
        }
    }

    virtual void handle(const Message& msg) = 0;
    virtual Strategy decide(const std::exception& e) {
        return Strategy::Restart;  // Default: restart
    }
    virtual void on_restart() {
        // Reset internal state, keep mailbox
    }

    ActorRef parent_;
};

struct ChildFailed {
    ActorRef child;
    std::string error;
};

// === Supervisor actor ===
class Supervisor : public Actor {
protected:
    void on_receive(const Message& msg) override {
        if (auto* fail = std::any_cast<ChildFailed>(&msg.payload)) {
            std::cout << "Child failed: " << fail->error << "\n";
            // Restart the child
            fail->child->stop();
            fail->child->start();
        }
    }
};
```

The key subtlety in `on_restart()`: it resets the actor's *internal state* but keeps the mailbox intact. Messages that were already queued before the failure will still be processed after the restart. Whether that's the right behavior depends on your application - sometimes you want to drain the mailbox on restart, sometimes not.

## Notes

- **Each actor processes messages sequentially** - no internal locking needed.
- Actors communicate only through messages; never share pointers to internal state.
- Message copies are the price of safety - use move semantics to minimize cost.
- Supervision hierarchies (parent restarts children) provide fault tolerance.
- For high-performance, use lock-free MPSC queues instead of `std::mutex` + `std::queue`.
- Real-world C++ actor libraries: CAF (C++ Actor Framework), SObjectizer, rotor.
- Actors scale naturally to distributed systems: replace local send with network send.
