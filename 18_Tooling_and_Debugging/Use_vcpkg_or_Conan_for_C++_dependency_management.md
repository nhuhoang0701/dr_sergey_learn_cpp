## Topic Overview

C++ has historically had no standard way to consume third-party libraries. You either installed things system-wide and hoped the versions matched, bundled source code directly, or wrestled with `find_package` scripts that assumed dependencies were in specific places. Package managers like vcpkg and Conan solve this by automating the download, build, and CMake integration of third-party dependencies in a way that is reproducible across machines and CI environments.

Both tools do the same core job, but they come from different worlds. vcpkg was built by Microsoft to integrate tightly with CMake and Visual Studio. Conan was built by JFrog and is more build-system-agnostic. Here's a quick comparison:

| Feature | vcpkg | Conan |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Maintainer | Microsoft | JFrog |
| Package count | 2,500+ | 1,500+ |
| CMake integration | Native toolchain file | Generator-based |
| Binary caching | Yes | Yes |
| Custom recipes | Ports | conanfile.py |
| Corporate proxy | Supported | Supported |

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Set up a CMake project with vcpkg to use Boost.Asio

vcpkg works best in "manifest mode", where you declare your dependencies in a `vcpkg.json` file checked into your repository. When CMake builds your project with the vcpkg toolchain file, vcpkg reads that manifest and automatically installs everything your project needs - no manual install step required.

```bash
# Step 1: Install vcpkg
$ git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
$ cd vcpkg && ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh  # Linux/macOS
# or .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat          # Windows
```

Place this manifest file at your project root. vcpkg reads it during the CMake configure step.

```json
// vcpkg.json (manifest file - place in project root)
{
    "name": "my-server",
    "version-string": "1.0.0",
    "dependencies": [
        "boost-asio",
        "fmt",
        "spdlog"
    ]
}
```

The `CMakeLists.txt` itself doesn't need to know about vcpkg at all. You just use the standard `find_package` and `target_link_libraries` - vcpkg makes those work by injecting its own package config files.

```cmake
# CMakeLists.txt
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)
project(MyServer LANGUAGES CXX)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)

# vcpkg provides find_package support automatically:
find_package(Boost REQUIRED COMPONENTS system)
find_package(fmt CONFIG REQUIRED)
find_package(spdlog CONFIG REQUIRED)

add_executable(server main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(server PRIVATE
    Boost::system
    fmt::fmt
    spdlog::spdlog
)
```

```cpp
// main.cpp
#include <boost/asio.hpp>
#include <fmt/format.h>
#include <spdlog/spdlog.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    boost::asio::io_context io;
    spdlog::info("Server starting...");
    fmt::print("Boost.Asio version: {}\n", BOOST_ASIO_VERSION);
}
```

The only vcpkg-specific thing in your build command is `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`. Everything else is standard CMake.

```bash
# Build with vcpkg toolchain:
$ cmake -B build \
    -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<vcpkg-root>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
$ cmake --build build
# vcpkg automatically installs dependencies from vcpkg.json
```

### Q2: vcpkg manifest mode vs classic mode

Classic mode is the older way: you run `vcpkg install boost-asio` once and the package goes into a global installation shared by all your projects. This is convenient for getting started, but it's a problem for reproducibility because the global state isn't captured in your repository.

Manifest mode is the recommended approach. Dependencies are declared in `vcpkg.json`, the file lives in your repo, and every developer or CI machine gets exactly the same set of packages automatically.

| Aspect | Classic Mode | Manifest Mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Install command | `vcpkg install boost-asio` | Automatic from `vcpkg.json` |
| Scope | Global (shared across projects) | Per-project |
| Version control | Not versioned | `vcpkg.json` checked into Git |
| Reproducibility | Depends on global state | Fully reproducible |
| CI friendly | Requires pre-install step | Self-contained |

```bash
# Classic mode (legacy):
$ vcpkg install boost-asio fmt spdlog
$ cmake -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=.../vcpkg.cmake
# Libraries installed globally in vcpkg/installed/

# Manifest mode (recommended):
# Just create vcpkg.json in project root:
$ cmake -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=.../vcpkg.cmake
# vcpkg reads vcpkg.json and installs to build/vcpkg_installed/
# Each project has its own dependency set

# Version pinning (vcpkg.json):
{
    "dependencies": [
        { "name": "fmt", "version>=": "10.0.0" }
    ],
    "builtin-baseline": "abc123..."  // pin vcpkg registry version
}
```

The `builtin-baseline` field is how you pin the entire vcpkg registry to a specific commit, ensuring you always get exactly the same package versions no matter when you build.

### Q3: Create a Conan recipe for a header-only library

Conan recipes are Python files. For a header-only library, the recipe is particularly simple because there's nothing to compile. You just need to tell Conan where the headers are and that there are no build artifacts to worry about.

```python
# conanfile.py - recipe for a header-only library
from conan import ConanFile
from conan.tools.files import copy
import os

class MyMathConan(ConanFile):
    name = "mymath"
    version = "1.0.0"
    license = "MIT"
    description = "A simple header-only math library"
    exports_sources = "include/*"
    no_copy_source = True  # header-only: no build needed

    def package(self):
        copy(self, "*.hpp",
             src=os.path.join(self.source_folder, "include"),
             dst=os.path.join(self.package_folder, "include"))

    def package_info(self):
        self.cpp_info.bindirs = []
        self.cpp_info.libdirs = []
        # Header-only: no libs to link

    def package_id(self):
        self.info.clear()  # Header-only: same package for all settings
```

The `package_id` method is important for header-only libraries. Since there's no compiled code, the package is the same regardless of the target platform, compiler version, or build type. Clearing `self.info` tells Conan not to build separate packages for each configuration - one download covers all.

```cpp
// include/mymath/math.hpp
#pragma once

namespace mymath {
    constexpr double pi = 3.14159265358979323846;

    constexpr int square(int x) { return x * x; }
    constexpr double circle_area(double r) { return pi * r * r; }
}
```

```bash
# Create and test the package:
$ conan create . --build=missing
# Exporting: mymath/1.0.0
# Package created: mymath/1.0.0

# Use in a consumer project:
# conanfile.txt:
[requires]
mymath/1.0.0

[generators]
CMakeDeps
CMakeToolchain

# Build:
$ conan install . --build=missing
$ cmake -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=build/conan_toolchain.cmake
$ cmake --build build
```

## Notes

- Use **manifest mode** for vcpkg (reproducible, version-controlled).
- Conan 2.x is the current major version; avoid Conan 1.x APIs.
- Both support binary caching for faster CI builds.
- vcpkg integrates more seamlessly with CMake's `find_package()`.
- Conan is more flexible for custom build systems and cross-compilation.
