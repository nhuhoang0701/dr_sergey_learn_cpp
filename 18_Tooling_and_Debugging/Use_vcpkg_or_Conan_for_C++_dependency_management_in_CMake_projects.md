# Use vcpkg or Conan for C++ dependency management in CMake projects

## Topic Overview

This guide focuses on the **CMake integration** patterns for vcpkg and Conan, including presets, CI workflows, and cross-compilation.

The important thing to understand up front is that both tools produce the same result from CMake's perspective: a set of CMake package config files that make standard `find_package()` calls work. Your `CMakeLists.txt` doesn't need to know which package manager you used. The difference is in how you set up the build - which toolchain file you pass to CMake, and where the generated files land.

```cpp
Dependency flow in CMake:

vcpkg:  vcpkg.json -> vcpkg install -> find_package() -> target_link_libraries()
Conan:  conanfile.txt -> conan install -> find_package() -> target_link_libraries()

Both produce CMake targets that work with standard find_package().

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Full vcpkg + CMake project with presets

CMake Presets (the `CMakePresets.json` file) are the modern way to capture build configuration. Instead of each developer having to remember which `-D` flags to pass, you define presets that the whole team shares. When combined with vcpkg, this is especially valuable because the vcpkg toolchain path is baked into the preset.

```json
// vcpkg.json
{
    "name": "webapp",
    "version-string": "1.0.0",
    "dependencies": [
        "boost-beast",
        "nlohmann-json",
        "openssl",
        "sqlite3"
    ]
}
```

The preset below uses `$env{VCPKG_ROOT}` so each developer sets an environment variable pointing to their vcpkg installation rather than hardcoding an absolute path. This is the standard convention for team projects.

```json
// CMakePresets.json - team-wide configuration
{
    "version": 6,
    "configurePresets": [
        {
            "name": "default",
            "generator": "Ninja",
            "binaryDir": "${sourceDir}/build",
            "cacheVariables": {
                "CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE": "$env{VCPKG_ROOT}/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake",
                "CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD": "20",
                "CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS": "ON"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "release",
            "inherits": "default",
            "cacheVariables": {
                "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE": "Release"
            }
        }
    ],
    "buildPresets": [
        {
            "name": "default",
            "configurePreset": "default"
        }
    ]
}
```

The `CMakeLists.txt` itself is completely standard CMake with no vcpkg-specific code - just `find_package` and `target_link_libraries`.

```cmake
# CMakeLists.txt
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)
project(WebApp LANGUAGES CXX)

find_package(Boost REQUIRED COMPONENTS system)
find_package(nlohmann_json CONFIG REQUIRED)
find_package(OpenSSL REQUIRED)
find_package(unofficial-sqlite3 CONFIG REQUIRED)

add_executable(webapp src/main.cpp src/server.cpp src/db.cpp)
target_link_libraries(webapp PRIVATE
    Boost::system
    nlohmann_json::nlohmann_json
    OpenSSL::SSL OpenSSL::Crypto
    unofficial::sqlite3::sqlite3
)
```

```bash
# Build using presets:
$ cmake --preset default
$ cmake --build --preset default
# vcpkg automatically installs all dependencies
```

### Q2: Conan 2.x CMake integration

Conan's workflow has an extra step compared to vcpkg: you run `conan install` explicitly before running CMake. That step generates the toolchain and find-module files that CMake then uses. This makes the dependency between Conan and CMake more visible, which some teams prefer.

```ini
# conanfile.txt (simple projects)
[requires]
boost/1.84.0
fmt/10.2.1
spdlog/1.13.0

[generators]
CMakeDeps
CMakeToolchain

[layout]
cmake_layout
```

```bash
# Install dependencies:
$ conan install . --output-folder=build --build=missing

# This generates:
#   build/conan_toolchain.cmake     (compiler settings)
#   build/FindBoost.cmake           (CMake find modules)
#   build/fmt-config.cmake
#   build/spdlog-config.cmake

# Configure and build:
$ cmake -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=build/conan_toolchain.cmake
$ cmake --build build
```

The `CMakeLists.txt` for a Conan project is identical to the vcpkg one - both use `find_package`. The only difference is that Conan places its generated files in the output folder rather than injecting them automatically through a toolchain file.

```cmake
# CMakeLists.txt (same as vcpkg - uses standard find_package):
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)
project(MyApp LANGUAGES CXX)

find_package(Boost REQUIRED)
find_package(fmt REQUIRED)
find_package(spdlog REQUIRED)

add_executable(app main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(app PRIVATE
    Boost::boost
    fmt::fmt
    spdlog::spdlog
)
```

For more complex projects you can use a Python `conanfile.py` instead of `conanfile.txt`. This gives you full control: you can conditionally include dependencies, set library options, and handle platform-specific configuration.

```python
# conanfile.py (advanced: with options and settings)
from conan import ConanFile

class MyAppConan(ConanFile):
    settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"
    requires = (
        "boost/1.84.0",
        "fmt/10.2.1",
    )
    generators = "CMakeDeps", "CMakeToolchain"

    def configure(self):
        # Only need Boost headers (no compiled libs):
        self.options["boost"].header_only = True
```

### Q3: CI workflow with dependency caching

The main performance concern with package managers in CI is build time. Without caching, every CI run downloads and builds all dependencies from source, which can take many minutes. Both vcpkg and Conan support binary caching - storing pre-built packages so they can be reused across runs.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/build.yml - vcpkg with binary caching
name: Build
on: [push, pull_request]

env:
  VCPKG_BINARY_SOURCES: 'clear;nuget,GitHub,readwrite'

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          submodules: true  # if vcpkg is a submodule
      - name: Setup vcpkg
        uses: lukka/run-vcpkg@v11
        with:
          vcpkgGitCommitId: 'abc123...'  # pin version
      - name: Cache vcpkg packages
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: build/vcpkg_installed
          key: vcpkg-${{ hashFiles('vcpkg.json') }}-${{ runner.os }}
      - name: Configure
        run: cmake --preset default
      - name: Build
        run: cmake --build --preset default
      - name: Test
        run: ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

The cache key is a hash of `vcpkg.json` combined with the OS name. This means the cache is automatically invalidated whenever you change your dependency list, but stays valid across unrelated commits - exactly the right behavior.

```yaml
# Conan CI with caching:

- name: Install Conan
  run: pip install conan

- name: Cache Conan packages
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.conan2
    key: conan-${{ hashFiles('conanfile.txt') }}-${{ runner.os }}

- name: Install dependencies
  run: conan install . --output-folder=build --build=missing

- name: Build
  run: |
    cmake -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=build/conan_toolchain.cmake
    cmake --build build
```

Conan's local cache lives in `~/.conan2`. Persisting that directory across runs means Conan only needs to download and build packages that haven't been seen before - already-built packages are reused directly from the cache.

---

## Notes

- Use CMakePresets.json with vcpkg for team-wide reproducible builds.
- vcpkg binary caching reduces CI time dramatically (skip rebuilding deps).
- Conan profiles handle cross-compilation: `conan install . -pr:h=arm64`.
- Both tools support lockfiles for fully reproducible builds.
- Prefer manifest mode (vcpkg.json / conanfile.txt) over global installs.
