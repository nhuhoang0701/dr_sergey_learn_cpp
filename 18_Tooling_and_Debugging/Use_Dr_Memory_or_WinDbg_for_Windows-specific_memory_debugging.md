## Topic Overview

If you come from a Linux background, you are probably used to Valgrind for memory error detection. Windows has its own ecosystem of complementary tools, each covering a different angle of the problem. Here is a quick map of what each tool is for:

| Tool | Purpose | Approach |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Dr. Memory** | Detect memory errors (leaks, overflows, use-after-free) | Dynamic binary instrumentation |
| **WinDbg** | Crash dump analysis, kernel debugging | Microsoft debugger |
| **PageHeap (gflags)** | Detect heap corruption at point of failure | Guard pages around allocations |
| **Application Verifier** | Broad error class detection | Runtime checks |

### Q1: Run Dr. Memory and interpret a heap overwrite report

Dr. Memory works by instrumenting your binary at runtime and watching every memory access. When it sees a write that falls outside a valid allocation, it reports the exact address, the size of the allocation, and the source location from your debug info. Here is a small program with two deliberate bugs:

```cpp
// heap_overwrite.cpp - compile with debug info:
// cl /Zi /Od heap_overwrite.cpp  (MSVC)
// g++ -g -O0 heap_overwrite.cpp -o heap_overwrite.exe  (MinGW)
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int* arr = new int[5];
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
        arr[i] = i * 10;

    arr[5] = 999;   // BUG: heap buffer overwrite (1 past end)
    arr[-1] = -1;   // BUG: underwrite

    std::cout << arr[0] << '\n';
    delete[] arr;
}
```

Run it through Dr. Memory and you will get a report that names the exact source line for each violation:

```powershell
# Run with Dr. Memory:
drmemory.exe -- heap_overwrite.exe

# Dr. Memory output:
# ~~Dr.M~~ Error #1: UNADDRESSABLE ACCESS beyond heap bounds
# ~~Dr.M~~ writing 4 byte(s) at 0x01234568
# ~~Dr.M~~ refers to 0 byte(s) beyond a 20-byte malloc
# ~~Dr.M~~    # 0 main          [heap_overwrite.cpp:10]
#
# ~~Dr.M~~ Error #2: UNADDRESSABLE ACCESS before heap bounds
# ~~Dr.M~~ writing 4 byte(s) at 0x01234550
# ~~Dr.M~~    # 0 main          [heap_overwrite.cpp:11]

# Reading the report:
# - "20-byte malloc" = 5 ints * 4 bytes = 20 bytes (correct)
# - "0 byte(s) beyond" = writing right at the end boundary
# - File:line tells you exactly where the bug is

# Common Dr. Memory options:
drmemory.exe -show_reachable -- myapp.exe    # show reachable leaks
drmemory.exe -light -- myapp.exe             # faster, fewer checks
drmemory.exe -logdir ./logs -- myapp.exe     # custom log directory
```

The `20-byte malloc` line is worth understanding: the tool tells you the original allocation size so you can immediately verify it matches your intention (5 ints * 4 bytes = 20 bytes - that is correct). The error is that you wrote to byte 20, which is the first byte past the end of the allocation.

### Q2: Use WinDbg `!analyze -v` to diagnose a crash dump

WinDbg is Microsoft's native debugger and is the standard tool for post-mortem analysis of crash dumps. When a program crashes in production and you cannot reproduce it interactively, a dump file is often your only evidence. Here is the minimal setup: a program that crashes, and the WinDbg workflow to diagnose it.

```cpp
// crash_example.cpp
#include <iostream>

void cause_crash() {
    int* p = nullptr;
    *p = 42;  // Access violation
}

int main() {
    std::cout << "About to crash...\n";
    cause_crash();
}
```

```powershell
# Step 1: Enable crash dumps via Windows Error Reporting
# Registry (or use procdump):
# HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps
# DumpType = 2 (Full dump)
#
# Or use procdump (Sysinternals):
# procdump -ma -e crash_example.exe

# Step 2: Open dump in WinDbg
# File -> Open Crash Dump -> crash_example.exe.dmp

# Step 3: Automatic analysis:
0:000> !analyze -v
# EXCEPTION_RECORD:  ACCESS_VIOLATION writing address 0x00000000
# FAULTING_IP:
#   crash_example!cause_crash+0x12
#     mov dword ptr [rax], 2Ah     ; 2Ah = 42 decimal
#
# STACK_TEXT:
#   crash_example!cause_crash+0x12  [crash_example.cpp @ 5]
#   crash_example!main+0x28         [crash_example.cpp @ 10]
#   kernel32!BaseThreadInitThunk
#
# SYMBOL_NAME: crash_example!cause_crash+12

# Step 4: Inspect variables
0:000> dv              ; display local variables
#   p = 0x00000000     ; confirmed null

0:000> k               ; stack trace
0:000> !heap -s        ; heap summary
0:000> !address -summary  ; memory summary
```

The `!analyze -v` command is the first thing you run on any crash dump. It automatically identifies the exception type, the faulting instruction, and the call stack, and often points you directly to the cause without any further manual investigation.

### Q3: Set up PageHeap to detect heap corruption at point of failure

The reason heap corruption bugs are so hard to track down without a tool is that the actual corruption and the eventual crash are often far apart in both time and code. You write past the end of a buffer, silently corrupt some adjacent heap metadata, and then the program crashes hundreds of instructions later when the heap tries to use that corrupted metadata. PageHeap solves this by placing an inaccessible guard page directly adjacent to every heap allocation, so any overwrite triggers an immediate access violation at the exact instruction that caused it.

```powershell
# PageHeap places guard pages around heap allocations
# so overflows cause immediate access violations (not silent corruption)

# Enable full PageHeap for an application:
gflags /p /enable myapp.exe /full

# Verify it's enabled:
gflags /p
# Output: myapp.exe: page heap enabled

# Now run the application - any heap overwrite triggers
# an immediate access violation at the exact instruction

# Disable when done (PageHeap adds significant overhead):
gflags /p /disable myapp.exe
```

Here is what would happen with and without PageHeap on a concrete example:

```cpp
// This corruption would be caught IMMEDIATELY with PageHeap:
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>

int main() {
    char* buf = new char[16];
    std::memset(buf, 'A', 32);  // Write 32 bytes into 16-byte buffer
                                 // Without PageHeap: silent corruption, crash later
                                 // With PageHeap: IMMEDIATE access violation HERE
    delete[] buf;
}
```

The memory layout that makes this possible looks like this:

```cpp
PageHeap memory layout:
┌───────────┬────────────────┬─────────────┬────────────┐
│ Guard     │ Your allocation │ Padding       │ Guard page │
│ page (NA) │ (16 bytes)      │ (alignment)   │ (NA)       │
└───────────┴────────────────┴─────────────┴────────────┘
  ^                                               ^
  Write before buffer =                          Write past buffer =
  immediate AV                                    immediate AV
```

Because both ends of every allocation are surrounded by pages marked as inaccessible, any out-of-bounds access - before or after the allocation - immediately faults at the guilty instruction. The trade-off is that PageHeap roughly doubles memory usage and adds significant runtime overhead, so you enable it only for debugging sessions.

## Notes

- Dr. Memory works with both MSVC and MinGW binaries.
- PageHeap uses ~2x memory and is slower; enable only for debugging.
- WinDbg Preview (from Microsoft Store) has a modern UI.
- `!heap -stat -h 0` in WinDbg shows per-heap allocation statistics.
- Application Verifier (`appverif.exe`) adds checks for handles, locks, and TLS.
