## Notes

- Lambdas are syntactic sugar for unnamed function objects — the compiler generates a closure class
- Capture by value [=] copies; capture by reference [&] aliases — beware dangling references
- Generic lambdas (uto parameters) are template function objects since C++14
- mutable lambdas can modify by-value captures — without it, operator() is const
- std::function type-erases callables but has overhead — prefer templates or uto when possible
- Immediately-invoked lambda expressions (IILE) are useful for complex initialization of const variables
- C++20 lambdas can be used in unevaluated contexts and have template parameter lists
- std::invoke calls any callable uniformly — works with functions, lambdas, and member pointers
- Recursive lambdas need std::function or a Y-combinator pattern — they cannot capture themselves
- Capture [*this] (C++17) copies the whole object — needed when the lambda outlives 	his

## Notes

- Ranges replace iterator pairs with single range objects — cleaner and less error-prone
- Views are lazy — std::views::filter | std::views::transform composes without allocation
- std::ranges::to<Container>() (C++23) materializes a lazy view into a container
- Range adaptors use the pipe (|) syntax for readable left-to-right composition
- Sentinel-based ranges allow different types for begin and end — enables null-terminated strings
- std::views::zip (C++23) combines multiple ranges element-wise into tuples
- Borrowed ranges ensure iterators remain valid even after the range is destroyed
- Projections in range algorithms eliminate the need for custom comparators in most cases
- std::views::chunk and std::views::slide (C++23) enable windowed processing patterns
- Custom views require implementing egin(), end(), and satisfying range concepts
