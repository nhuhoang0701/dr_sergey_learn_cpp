## Topic Overview

CMake 3.28 introduced **native C++20 module support** via the `CXX_MODULES` file set type. Before 3.28, module support was experimental (requiring `CMAKE_EXPERIMENTAL_CXX_MODULE_DYNDEP`). If you have been avoiding modules in CMake because the tooling felt unfinished, 3.28 is the version where it became practical.

### Key CMake Features for Modules

| Feature | CMake Version | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FILE_SET CXX_MODULES` | 3.28+ | Declare module interface files |
| Dependency scanning | 3.28+ | Automatic `import` scanning (P1689R5) |
| Module BMI caching | 3.28+ | Reuse compiled module interfaces |
| `import std` | 3.30+ | Standard library module import |
| Generator support | Ninja 1.11+, MSBuild 17.4+ | Required build generators |

### Build Order: Headers vs Modules

With traditional headers, all translation units can compile in parallel because the compiler resolves `#include` during its own preprocessing pass. With modules, the build system must first scan for `import` and `export` declarations, then build a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and finally compile in topological order. This is why your build generator matters - not every generator can handle dynamic dependency injection.

```cpp
HEADER-BASED BUILD (all TUs compile in parallel):
  [a.cpp] ---+
  [b.cpp] ---+-- (parallel) --> link
  [c.cpp] ---+

MODULE-BASED BUILD (dependency scanning creates order):
  [my_math.cppm]  --> compile module interface --+
  [main.cpp]      ------ (waits for module) -----+-> link
  [utils.cpp]     ------ (parallel, no module dep) -+
```

Modules require the build system to **scan for `import` declarations** before compiling, creating a DAG (directed acyclic graph) of module dependencies.

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Write a CMakeLists.txt using `target_sources` with `FILE_SET CXX_MODULES` for a module

The project structure below separates the module interface (`.cppm`), implementation (`.cpp`), and consumer (`main.cpp`).

**Project structure:**

```cpp
project/
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── src/
│   ├── math.cppm          # module interface unit
│   ├── math_impl.cpp      # module implementation unit
│   └── main.cpp
```

**CMakeLists.txt:**

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.28)
project(ModuleDemo LANGUAGES CXX)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

add_executable(app)

target_sources(app
  PRIVATE
    src/main.cpp
    src/math_impl.cpp
)

# Declare module interface files with FILE_SET CXX_MODULES
target_sources(app
  PUBLIC
    FILE_SET CXX_MODULES FILES
      src/math.cppm
)
```

The module interface declares what is exported. Only the names prefixed with `export` will be visible to importers.

**src/math.cppm** (module interface):

```cpp
export module math;

export int add(int a, int b);
export int multiply(int a, int b);

export namespace geometry {
    double circle_area(double radius);
}
```

The implementation unit belongs to the same module but defines the function bodies. It never shows up in the exported interface.

**src/math_impl.cpp** (module implementation):

```cpp
module math;

import <cmath>;  // or #include <cmath> if header units unsupported

int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
int multiply(int a, int b) { return a * b; }

namespace geometry {
    double circle_area(double radius) { return std::acos(-1.0) * radius * radius; }
}
```

The consumer just imports the module by name and uses everything that was exported.

**src/main.cpp:**

```cpp
import math;
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "3 + 4 = " << add(3, 4) << '\n';
    std::cout << "3 * 4 = " << multiply(3, 4) << '\n';
    std::cout << "Circle area r=5: " << geometry::circle_area(5.0) << '\n';
}
// Expected output:
// 3 + 4 = 7
// 3 * 4 = 12
// Circle area r=5: 78.5398
```

**Key points:**

- `FILE_SET CXX_MODULES` tells CMake these `.cppm` files are module interfaces.
- CMake scans these files for `export module ...` and `import ...` to build the dependency graph.
- Use Ninja 1.11+ or Visual Studio 17.4+ as the generator.

### Q2: Explain the build system's dependency scanning requirement for modules vs textual includes

The fundamental difference is where responsibility lies. With headers, the compiler figures out includes on its own during preprocessing. With modules, the build system has to figure out the ordering before it can call the compiler at all.

**Headers (textual includes):**

```cpp
Step 1: Parse source files       <- no scanning needed
Step 2: Compile ALL .cpp in parallel <- preprocessor handles #include during compilation
Step 3: Link

The compiler resolves #include during preprocessing - no build system involvement.
```

**Modules:**

```cpp
Step 1: SCAN all source files for import/export declarations (P1689R5 format)
Step 2: Build dependency DAG from scan results
Step 3: Compile module interfaces in topological order
Step 4: Compile implementation units (can use compiled module interfaces)
Step 5: Link

The build system MUST know module dependencies BEFORE compilation.
```

Here is the concrete reason scanning is necessary. When the build system sees `import math;` in a file, it cannot start compiling that file until it knows which other file provides `module math` and that file has already been compiled.

**Why scanning is necessary:**

```cpp
// file: main.cpp
import math;   // The build system must know:
               //  1. Which file provides "module math"?
               //  2. Is that module already compiled?
               //  3. Where is the BMI (binary module interface)?
```

| Aspect | `#include` (headers) | `import` (modules) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Resolution | Compiler, during preprocessing | Build system, before compile |
| Dependency info | Implicit (include paths) | Explicit (scanned declarations) |
| Build order | All TUs independent | Module interfaces must compile first |
| Rebuild trigger | File timestamp | Module interface change -> recompile importers |
| Standard format | None | P1689R5 JSON dependency format |

### Q3: Show the difference in build parallelism between header-based and module-based builds

It seems like modules should be slower because of serialization, but the trade-off is more nuanced. Headers allow full parallelism but each TU re-parses every header it includes. Modules reduce parallelism on DAG edges but eliminate the repeated parsing work entirely.

**Header-based: Maximum parallelism**

```cpp
Time  ->  [=====]  a.cpp        All 4 files compile
         [=====]  b.cpp        simultaneously.
         [=====]  c.cpp        Each re-parses every
         [=====]  d.cpp        #included header.
               [==] LINK

Total: 5 + 2 = 7 time units
Redundant work: each TU parses <vector>, <string>, etc. independently
```

**Module-based: Ordered but less redundant work**

```cpp
Time  ->  [==]  math.cppm      Module interface compiles first
              [=] b.cpp        Importers wait for module BMI,
              [=] c.cpp        but compile faster (no re-parsing)
              [=] d.cpp
                  [==] LINK

Total: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 time units
Module BMI compiled once, reused by all importers
```

**Key tradeoffs:**

| Metric | Headers | Modules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Parallelism | All TUs independent | DAG-constrained |
| Per-TU compile time | Slower (re-parses headers) | Faster (reads BMI) |
| Total build time | Depends on redundant parsing | Depends on module DAG depth |
| Incremental rebuild | Recompile changed TU only | Recompile module + all importers |
| Clean build | O(N x H) parsing work | O(N + M) parsing work |

- N = number of translation units, H = average headers per TU, M = number of modules
- Modules win on **clean builds** of large projects because header re-parsing dominates.
- For small projects, the scanning overhead may negate the benefit.

## Notes

- Use `.cppm`, `.ixx` (MSVC), or `.mpp` extensions for module interface files - CMake recognizes these.
- Set `CMAKE_CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES ON` (default in 3.28+ for C++20 targets).
- Ninja is strongly recommended over Make for module builds (Make lacks dynamic dependency support).
- Module support varies by compiler: MSVC 17.4+ (best), GCC 14+, Clang 16+ (partial).
