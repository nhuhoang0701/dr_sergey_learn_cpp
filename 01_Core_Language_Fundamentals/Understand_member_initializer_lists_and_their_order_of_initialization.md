## Topic Overview

A **member initializer list** appears after a constructor's parameter list, prefixed by a colon. It specifies how each data member and base class is initialized before the constructor body executes.

### Why Use Initializer Lists

| Initialization Method | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Member initializer list | Direct-initializes each member — one construction |
| Assignment in constructor body | Default-constructs, then assigns — two operations |

For `const` members, references, and types without default constructors, the initializer list is **mandatory**.

### Initialization Order Rules

**The order of initialization is always:**

1. Virtual base classes (depth-first, left-to-right)
2. Direct base classes (left-to-right in the inheritance list)
3. Non-static data members (**in declaration order**, NOT initializer list order)
4. Constructor body executes

```cpp

class Widget {
    int a;     // initialized 1st
    int b;     // initialized 2nd
    int c;     // initialized 3rd
public:
    // WARNING: initializer list order does NOT match declaration order!
    Widget(int x) : c(x), b(c), a(b) {}  // BUG!
    // Actual initialization order: a(b), b(c), c(x)
    // a uses uninitialized b, b uses uninitialized c
};

```

### Destruction Order

Members are destroyed in **reverse declaration order** — the exact mirror of construction. This guarantees that if member B was initialized after member A, B is destroyed before A.

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Show a bug where member initializer list order differs from member declaration order

```cpp

#include <iostream>

class BadOrder {
    int length;   // declared 1st → initialized 1st
    int capacity; // declared 2nd → initialized 2nd
public:
    // Initializer list says: capacity first, then length
    // But actual init order is: length first (uses capacity which is garbage!)
    BadOrder(int cap)
        : capacity(cap),          // LOOKS like this runs first, but it doesn't!
          length(capacity / 2)    // LOOKS second, but actually runs FIRST
    {
        std::cout << "length   = " << length << "\n";    // garbage value!
        std::cout << "capacity = " << capacity << "\n";  // correct: cap
    }
};

class GoodOrder {
    int length;
    int capacity;
public:
    // Match initializer list order to declaration order
    GoodOrder(int cap)
        : length(cap / 2),    // 1st — matches declaration order
          capacity(cap)        // 2nd — matches declaration order
    {
        std::cout << "length   = " << length << "\n";    // cap/2
        std::cout << "capacity = " << capacity << "\n";  // cap
    }
};

int main() {
    std::cout << "--- BadOrder ---\n";
    BadOrder bad(100);    // length = garbage, capacity = 100

    std::cout << "--- GoodOrder ---\n";
    GoodOrder good(100);  // length = 50, capacity = 100
}

```

**How this works:**

- In `BadOrder`, `length` is declared before `capacity`, so `length` is initialized first.
- The initializer list says `length(capacity / 2)` — but `capacity` hasn't been initialized yet at that point.
- `length` gets an **uninitialized garbage value**, causing undefined behavior.
- The fix: always write the initializer list in the same order as the member declarations.

### Q2: Explain that C++ initializes members in declaration order, not initializer list order

**Answer:**

The C++ standard (§[class.base.init]/13) specifies:

- Non-static data members are initialized in the order they are **declared in the class definition**.
- The order in the member initializer list is **irrelevant** to the actual initialization sequence.

**Rationale:** Destructors must run in a single, deterministic reverse order. If initialization order depended on which constructor was called, different constructors could produce different destruction orders — making cleanup unpredictable.

```cpp

class Example {
    std::string name;   // 1st declared → 1st initialized, last destroyed
    std::vector<int> v; // 2nd declared → 2nd initialized, destroyed before name
    int count;          // 3rd declared → 3rd initialized, destroyed first
public:
    // These all initialize in the SAME order: name, v, count
    Example() : count(0), v{}, name("default") {}   // list order ignored
    Example(int n) : name("custom"), count(n), v(n) {} // list order ignored
};

```

| What determines order? | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Declaration order in class | ✅ Always |
| Initializer list order | ❌ Never |
| Constructor parameter order | ❌ No |
| Base class order | Left-to-right in inheritance list |

### Q3: Add a compiler warning for out-of-order initializers (-Wreorder in GCC/Clang)

```cpp

// Compile with: g++ -std=c++20 -Wall -Wreorder init_order.cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class Config {
    std::string name;   // declared 1st
    int priority;       // declared 2nd
    bool active;        // declared 3rd
public:
    // Intentionally wrong order to trigger -Wreorder warning
    Config(const std::string& n, int p)
        : priority(p),       // WARNING: 'priority' will be initialized after 'name'
          name(n),           // WARNING: 'name' will be initialized before 'priority'
          active(true)       // OK: declared last, listed last
    {
        std::cout << name << " prio=" << priority << " active=" << active << "\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    Config c("server", 5);
}

// GCC/Clang output with -Wreorder:
// warning: 'Config::priority' will be initialized after 'Config::name'
//          [-Wreorder]
//
// MSVC equivalent: /W4 enables warning C5038
// warning C5038: data member 'Config::priority' will be initialized
//                after data member 'Config::name'

```

**How this works:**

- `-Wreorder` (included in `-Wall`) warns when the initializer list order doesn't match declaration order.
- MSVC uses warning C5038 (enabled by `/W4`).
- **Best practice:** Always write the initializer list in declaration order, and compile with warnings enabled. Many teams treat `-Werror` as policy to catch this.

## Notes

- Member initializer lists are more efficient than assignment in the body — they avoid default-construction + copy-assignment for non-trivial types.
- `const` members, reference members, and members of types with no default constructor **must** be initialized in the initializer list.
- Default member initializers (C++11 `int x = 0;` in-class) are overridden by the initializer list — they act as a fallback when a member isn't mentioned in the list.
- Virtual base classes are always initialized by the **most derived class**, regardless of where they appear in intermediate constructors.
- Use `-Wreorder` (GCC/Clang) or `/W4` (MSVC) to catch mismatched initializer list order at compile time.
