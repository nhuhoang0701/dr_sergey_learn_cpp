## Notes

- GoogleTest (gtest) and Catch2 are the two most popular C++ testing frameworks
- Property-based testing (RapidCheck) generates random inputs to find edge cases
- Fuzz testing (libFuzzer, AFL++) discovers crashes and undefined behavior through random mutation
- Mock objects (gmock, trompeloeil) isolate units under test from dependencies
- Code coverage (gcov, llvm-cov) measures which lines are exercised - aim for meaningful coverage, not 100%
- Sanitizers (ASan, TSan, UBSan) should run alongside tests in CI for maximum bug detection
- Static analysis complements testing - analyzers catch bugs that may never trigger at runtime
- Contract testing (pre/post-conditions) validates assumptions at API boundaries
- Benchmark tests (Google Benchmark) prevent performance regressions between releases
- Integration tests verify component interactions - don't rely solely on unit tests
