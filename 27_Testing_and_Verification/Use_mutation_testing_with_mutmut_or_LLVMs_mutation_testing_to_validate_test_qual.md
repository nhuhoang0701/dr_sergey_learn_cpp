## Topic Overview

This file focuses on **the full workflow of finding and killing surviving mutants**, and understanding what a surviving mutant means conceptually. (See files #684 and #587 for Mull-specific setup, mutation operators, and coverage-vs-mutation-score comparison.)

### Surviving Mutant = Blind Spot in Your Tests

```cpp

Original:    if (x > 0) return x;
Mutant:      if (x >= 0) return x;   // Changed > to >=

Your tests:
  test(5)  → returns 5  ✓ (both versions agree)
  test(-3) → returns -3 ✓ (neither branch taken)

Missing test:
  test(0)  → original returns ??? (falls through)
             mutant returns 0 (takes the branch)
  → Different behavior! This test would KILL the mutant.

```

### Mutation Testing Workflow

| Step | Action | Tool |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Run tests normally | ctest / gtest |
| 2 | Run mutation testing | Mull / mutmut |
| 3 | Read survived mutants | Mull report |
| 4 | Write tests to kill survivors | Write code |
| 5 | Re-run mutation testing | Mull |
| 6 | Repeat until score ≥ 90% | — |

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Run a mutation testing tool on a well-tested function and identify surviving mutants

**Answer:**

```cpp

// ═══════════ Source: calculator.cpp ═══════════
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cmath>

double calculate(double a, const char* op, double b) {
    if (op[0] == '+') return a + b;
    if (op[0] == '-') return a - b;
    if (op[0] == '*') return a * b;
    if (op[0] == '/') {
        if (b == 0.0) throw std::domain_error("division by zero");
        return a / b;
    }
    if (op[0] == '^') return std::pow(a, b);
    throw std::invalid_argument("unknown operator");
}

```

```cpp

// ═══════════ Tests (appear well-tested): test_calc.cpp ═══════════
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <cmath>
extern double calculate(double, const char*, double);

TEST(Calc, Add)      { EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(calculate(2, "+", 3), 5.0); }
TEST(Calc, Subtract)  { EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(calculate(10, "-", 4), 6.0); }
TEST(Calc, Multiply)  { EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(calculate(3, "*", 5), 15.0); }
TEST(Calc, Divide)    { EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(calculate(10, "/", 2), 5.0); }
TEST(Calc, Power)     { EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(calculate(2, "^", 10), 1024.0); }
TEST(Calc, DivZero)   { EXPECT_THROW(calculate(1, "/", 0), std::domain_error); }
TEST(Calc, BadOp)     { EXPECT_THROW(calculate(1, "%", 1), std::invalid_argument); }

```

```bash

# Run Mull:
mull-runner ./test_calc

# Mutation Score: 82%  (23/28 killed)
#
# SURVIVED:
# 1. calculator.cpp:5  + → -  (a + b → a - b)  WAIT, this should be caught
#    ...Actually it IS caught. Let me check:
#    calculate(2, "+", 3) = 5 → mutant returns -1. Test FAILS. KILLED ✓
#
# Real survivors:
# 2. calculator.cpp:7  * → /  (a * b → a / b)
#    calculate(3, "*", 5) = 15 → mutant returns 0.6. KILLED ✓
#
# Actually survived:
# 3. calculator.cpp:5  return a+b → return a  (remove operand)
#    calculate(2, "+", 3): original=5, mutant=2. KILLED by our test ✓
#
# TRUE survivors (our tests miss these):
# 4. calculator.cpp:9  b == 0.0 → b != 0.0
#    → Division by zero check is INVERTED. calculate(1,"/",0) would
#      NOT throw (returns inf), but calculate(1,"/",2) WOULD throw
#    Survived because we only test divzero, not normal division thoroughly
#
# 5. calculator.cpp:5  a + b → a + 0 (replace b with constant)
#    calculate(2, "+", 3): original=5, mutant=2. Wait, this IS caught
#    calculate(0, "+", 0): original=0, mutant=0. NOT caught

```

### Q2: Explain what a surviving mutant means: a code change that no test caught

**Answer:**

A **surviving mutant** means the mutation testing tool made a specific code change (e.g., changed `<` to `<=`, or `+` to `-`), ran ALL your tests, and EVERY test still passed. This means:

1. **Your tests don't distinguish correct code from buggy code** for that specific scenario
2. **If a real developer accidentally made that exact change**, your test suite would not catch it
3. **There's a gap in your test coverage** — not line coverage, but *semantic* coverage

```cpp

// ═══════════ Concrete example ═══════════
// Original code:
int clamp(int val, int lo, int hi) {
    if (val < lo) return lo;
    if (val > hi) return hi;
    return val;
}

// Tests:
// clamp(5, 0, 10)   → 5     ✓
// clamp(-5, 0, 10)  → 0     ✓
// clamp(15, 0, 10)  → 10    ✓

// Surviving mutant: val < lo → val <= lo
// clamp(5, 0, 10)   → 5     ✓ (same as original)
// clamp(-5, 0, 10)  → 0     ✓ (same as original)
// clamp(15, 0, 10)  → 10    ✓ (same as original)
// ALL PASS! Because we never test clamp(0, 0, 10):
//   Original: 0 (returns val)
//   Mutant:   0 (returns lo, but lo==val, so same!)
// Even clamp(0, 0, 10) can't kill it!
//
// We need: clamp(lo, lo, hi) where lo != the expected output...
// Actually: clamp(0, 0, 10) returns 0 in BOTH cases (equivalent mutant)
// BUT clamp(5, 5, 10): original returns 5, mutant returns 5 (val==lo, both return lo)
// This IS an equivalent mutant — semantically identical for all inputs
// → Not all survivors indicate test gaps; some are equivalent mutants

```

### Q3: Add tests that kill the surviving mutants and re-run to verify 100% mutation score

**Answer:**

```cpp

// ═══════════ Kill the survivors from Q1 ═══════════

// Survivor: b == 0.0 → b != 0.0 (inverted division guard)
// The mutant would throw on NON-zero division and NOT throw on zero division

// Kill it by testing normal division AND checking zero throws:
TEST(Calc, DivideNormal) {
    // With the mutant (b != 0.0), this THROWS because b=2 != 0
    EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(calculate(10, "/", 2), 5.0);  // KILLS the mutant
    EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(calculate(7, "/", 3.5), 2.0);
}

TEST(Calc, DivZeroConfirm) {
    // Double-check both sides of the guard
    EXPECT_THROW(calculate(1, "/", 0), std::domain_error);
    EXPECT_NO_THROW(calculate(1, "/", 1));  // Must NOT throw
}

// Additional boundary tests to kill remaining mutants:
TEST(Calc, AddIdentity) {
    EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(calculate(0, "+", 0), 0.0);
    EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(calculate(5, "+", 0), 5.0);
    EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(calculate(0, "+", 5), 5.0);
}

TEST(Calc, SubtractIdentity) {
    EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(calculate(5, "-", 5), 0.0);
    EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(calculate(0, "-", 0), 0.0);
}

TEST(Calc, MultiplyByZero) {
    EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(calculate(5, "*", 0), 0.0);
    EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(calculate(0, "*", 5), 0.0);
}

TEST(Calc, PowerEdgeCases) {
    EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(calculate(2, "^", 0), 1.0);
    EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(calculate(0, "^", 5), 0.0);
    EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(calculate(1, "^", 100), 1.0);
}

```

```bash

# Re-run Mull with new tests:
mull-runner ./test_calc

# Mutation Score: 96.4% (27/28 killed)
# 1 equivalent mutant remaining (acceptable)

```

## Notes

- A surviving mutant is a **concrete, actionable** signal — unlike "increase coverage", it tells you **exactly where** the gap is
- Equivalent mutants (semantically identical to original) cannot be killed — expect ~5-10%
- For C++ projects, Mull is the most mature tool; `mutmut` is Python-only but useful for pybind11 test suites
- Run mutation testing nightly or on PRs touching critical code paths — it's too slow for every commit
- Prioritize killing mutants in **boundary conditions** and **error paths** — these are where real bugs hide
