## Topic Overview

The **Command pattern** encapsulates an action as an object with `execute()` and `undo()` methods. The idea is that instead of directly modifying state, you wrap each operation in a command object, execute it through a manager, and let the manager keep a stack of what happened. This gives you undo/redo essentially for free.

Combined with **move semantics**, commands are transferred between undo/redo stacks without copying. This matters when commands carry large state - think a drawing command that stores pixel data, or a replace-all command that stores thousands of changed positions. Move semantics turn what would be expensive copies into O(1) pointer transfers.

### Architecture

Here's the flow of ownership through the system. Commands move into the undo stack after execution, then move into the redo stack on undo, then move back on redo. Nothing is ever copied.

```cpp
User action
    │
    ▼
 Command (execute + undo)
    │ std::move
    ▼
 undo_stack: vector<unique_ptr<Command>>
    │ undo() + std::move
    ▼
 redo_stack: vector<unique_ptr<Command>>
    │ redo() + std::move
    ▼
 back to undo_stack
```

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Define a Command interface with execute() and undo(), stored as unique\_ptr\<Command\> in a history stack

**Answer:**

The `unique_ptr<Command>` is not just a memory management choice - it's the mechanism that enforces single ownership. A command lives in exactly one place at a time: either the undo stack or the redo stack, never both.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <memory>
#include <vector>

// Command interface
class Command {
public:
    virtual ~Command() = default;
    virtual void execute() = 0;
    virtual void undo() = 0;
    virtual std::string description() const = 0;
};

// Document model
class Document {
    std::string text_;
public:
    void insert(size_t pos, const std::string& s) {
        text_.insert(pos, s);
    }
    void erase(size_t pos, size_t len) {
        text_.erase(pos, len);
    }
    const std::string& text() const { return text_; }
};

// InsertCommand
class InsertCommand : public Command {
    Document& doc_;
    size_t pos_;
    std::string text_;
public:
    InsertCommand(Document& doc, size_t pos, std::string text)
        : doc_(doc), pos_(pos), text_(std::move(text)) {}

    void execute() override { doc_.insert(pos_, text_); }
    void undo() override    { doc_.erase(pos_, text_.size()); }
    std::string description() const override {
        return "Insert '" + text_ + "' at " + std::to_string(pos_);
    }
};

// History stack
class History {
    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Command>> undo_stack_;
public:
    void execute(std::unique_ptr<Command> cmd) {
        cmd->execute();
        undo_stack_.push_back(std::move(cmd));  // move into stack
    }
    void undo() {
        if (undo_stack_.empty()) return;
        undo_stack_.back()->undo();
        undo_stack_.pop_back();
    }
};

int main() {
    Document doc;
    History history;

    history.execute(std::make_unique<InsertCommand>(doc, 0, "Hello"));
    history.execute(std::make_unique<InsertCommand>(doc, 5, " World"));
    std::cout << doc.text() << '\n';  // Hello World

    history.undo();
    std::cout << doc.text() << '\n';  // Hello

    history.undo();
    std::cout << doc.text() << '\n';  // (empty)
}
```

Notice the constructor of `InsertCommand` takes the `text` parameter by value and then `std::move`s it into `text_`. That means the caller's string is moved into the command cheaply, rather than copied.

### Q2: Use std::move to efficiently push commands onto the undo stack without copying

**Answer:**

The motivation for move semantics here becomes very concrete when commands hold large data. A drawing command might capture megabytes of pixel data. Without move semantics, pushing that onto a stack would copy all of it - potentially multiple times as the vector grows. With move semantics, only the pointer transfers.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class Command {
public:
    virtual ~Command() = default;
    virtual void execute() = 0;
    virtual void undo() = 0;
};

// Command with large captured state
class DrawCommand : public Command {
    std::vector<float> pixels_;  // Could be megabytes of data
    int layer_;
public:
    DrawCommand(std::vector<float> pixels, int layer)
        : pixels_(std::move(pixels))   // Move-construct: O(1), no copy
        , layer_(layer) {}

    void execute() override {
        std::cout << "Draw " << pixels_.size() << " pixels on layer "
                  << layer_ << '\n';
    }
    void undo() override {
        std::cout << "Erase " << pixels_.size() << " pixels from layer "
                  << layer_ << '\n';
    }
};

int main() {
    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Command>> undo_stack;

    // Create command with large pixel data
    std::vector<float> big_data(1'000'000, 1.0f);
    auto cmd = std::make_unique<DrawCommand>(std::move(big_data), 0);
    // big_data is now empty - ownership transferred to DrawCommand

    cmd->execute();
    undo_stack.push_back(std::move(cmd));
    // cmd is now nullptr - ownership transferred to undo_stack

    std::cout << "Stack size: " << undo_stack.size() << '\n';

    // No copies at any point - only moves
    // Without move semantics: 2 copies of 1M floats = 8MB wasted
    // With move semantics: 0 copies, just pointer transfers
}
```

After each `std::move`, the source is left in a valid but empty state. That is intentional and safe - you just shouldn't use `big_data` or `cmd` after moving from them, since their contents have been transferred elsewhere.

### Q3: Implement redo by maintaining a separate redo stack and moving commands between stacks

**Answer:**

Redo is where the ownership model really pays off. A command moves from the undo stack to the redo stack when you undo, and moves back when you redo. No cloning needed. There's one important rule: when you execute a new command, the redo stack must be cleared. Otherwise you'd have redo history that no longer makes sense given the new branching history.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class Command {
public:
    virtual ~Command() = default;
    virtual void execute() = 0;
    virtual void undo() = 0;
    virtual std::string name() const = 0;
};

// Full Undo/Redo Manager
class UndoRedoManager {
    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Command>> undo_stack_;
    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Command>> redo_stack_;
public:
    void execute(std::unique_ptr<Command> cmd) {
        cmd->execute();
        undo_stack_.push_back(std::move(cmd));
        redo_stack_.clear();  // New action invalidates redo history
    }

    void undo() {
        if (undo_stack_.empty()) { std::cout << "Nothing to undo\n"; return; }
        auto cmd = std::move(undo_stack_.back());  // Move out of undo
        undo_stack_.pop_back();
        cmd->undo();
        redo_stack_.push_back(std::move(cmd));      // Move into redo
    }

    void redo() {
        if (redo_stack_.empty()) { std::cout << "Nothing to redo\n"; return; }
        auto cmd = std::move(redo_stack_.back());   // Move out of redo
        redo_stack_.pop_back();
        cmd->execute();
        undo_stack_.push_back(std::move(cmd));      // Move back into undo
    }
};

// Simple counter command for demonstration
class AddCommand : public Command {
    int& value_;
    int amount_;
public:
    AddCommand(int& value, int amount) : value_(value), amount_(amount) {}
    void execute() override { value_ += amount_; }
    void undo() override    { value_ -= amount_; }
    std::string name() const override { return "Add " + std::to_string(amount_); }
};

int main() {
    int counter = 0;
    UndoRedoManager mgr;

    mgr.execute(std::make_unique<AddCommand>(counter, 10));
    mgr.execute(std::make_unique<AddCommand>(counter, 20));
    std::cout << counter << '\n';    // 30

    mgr.undo();                       // Undo +20
    std::cout << counter << '\n';    // 10

    mgr.undo();                       // Undo +10
    std::cout << counter << '\n';    // 0

    mgr.redo();                       // Redo +10
    std::cout << counter << '\n';    // 10

    mgr.redo();                       // Redo +20
    std::cout << counter << '\n';    // 30

    mgr.undo();                       // Undo +20
    mgr.execute(std::make_unique<AddCommand>(counter, 5));  // New action
    std::cout << counter << '\n';    // 15
    mgr.redo();                       // Nothing - redo cleared by new action
}
```

Watch the last few lines: after undoing +20 and then executing a new +5 command, the redo stack is cleared. Attempting to redo prints "Nothing to redo" because the history branched at that point and the old future no longer exists.

## Notes

- `unique_ptr` enforces single ownership - commands cannot be accidentally shared between stacks, which would make undo/redo logic inconsistent.
- `redo_stack_.clear()` on new execute is essential - otherwise redo history is inconsistent with the current state.
- Move semantics make this pattern practical even with commands capturing large state (images, pixel buffers, document snapshots).
- Consider `std::deque` instead of `vector` if you need to limit history depth with efficient front removal - see file _2 for that variant.
