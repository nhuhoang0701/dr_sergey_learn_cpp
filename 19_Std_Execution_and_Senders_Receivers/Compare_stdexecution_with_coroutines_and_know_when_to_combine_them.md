## Topic Overview

Coroutines (C++20) and senders/receivers (P2300/C++26) are complementary async models. They are not competing alternatives - they solve slightly different problems and are often best used together. Coroutines give you sequential-looking code that is easy to read; senders give you composable pipelines that are easy to run in parallel and easy to route to specific execution contexts.

| Aspect | Coroutines | Senders/Receivers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Syntax | `co_await`, `co_return` | Pipe operator `\|` |
| Abstraction | Suspend/resume points | Lazy value channels |
| Allocation | Coroutine frame (heap by default) | Operation states (often stack) |
| Cancellation | Manual (stop_token wiring) | Built-in (stopped channel) |
| Composition | Sequential by default | Parallel fan-out (when_all) |
| Structured concurrency | Library-provided | First-class (async_scope) |
| Best for | Sequential async logic | Parallel pipelines, scheduler control |

Here is what each model looks like at a glance, side by side:

```cpp
Coroutine:                    Sender pipeline:
task<int> foo() {             auto s = just(42)
  auto x = co_await bar();      | then([](int x) {
  auto y = co_await baz(x);         return x * 2;
  co_return x + y;               })
}                               | then(to_string);
```

The coroutine reads like ordinary sequential code; the sender pipeline reads like a data transformation chain. The good news is you do not have to choose one or the other.

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Make a sender awaitable in a coroutine with `co_await`

The bridge between the two worlds is `co_await`. When you have a coroutine type that understands senders (like `exec::task`), you can `co_await` any sender directly - the coroutine suspends, the sender runs, and when it completes the coroutine resumes with the value. The example below also shows the other direction: a coroutine is itself a sender and can be dropped into a pipeline with `|`.

```cpp
// Using stdexec (NVIDIA P2300 reference implementation)
#include <stdexec/execution.hpp>
#include <exec/static_thread_pool.hpp>
#include <exec/task.hpp>   // provides exec::task coroutine type
#include <iostream>

// exec::task is a coroutine type that can co_await senders:
exec::task<int> compute_async() {
    // co_await a sender -> suspends until the sender completes,
    // then resumes with the value:
    int x = co_await stdexec::just(21);
    std::cout << "Got: " << x << '\n';

    // Chain senders inside a coroutine:
    auto doubled = co_await (
        stdexec::just(x)
        | stdexec::then([](int v) { return v * 2; })
    );
    std::cout << "Doubled: " << doubled << '\n';

    co_return doubled;  // 42
}

int main() {
    exec::static_thread_pool pool(4);
    auto sched = pool.get_scheduler();

    // The coroutine itself IS a sender - can be used in pipelines:
    auto pipeline =
        stdexec::starts_on(sched, compute_async())
        | stdexec::then([](int result) {
            std::cout << "Pipeline got: " << result << '\n';
            return result;
        });

    auto [val] = stdexec::sync_wait(std::move(pipeline)).value();
    std::cout << "Final: " << val << '\n';  // 42
}
// Output:
// Got: 21
// Doubled: 42
// Pipeline got: 42
// Final: 42
```

The coroutine `compute_async()` uses `co_await` to suspend and receive values from senders, and is then itself composed into a sender pipeline using `starts_on` and `|`. Both directions work seamlessly.

**How it works:**

- `exec::task<T>` is both a coroutine type and a sender.
- `co_await sender` connects the sender, starts it, suspends the coroutine, and resumes with the result.
- The coroutine can be composed into sender pipelines via `|`.

### Q2: When to prefer senders vs coroutines

The decision usually comes down to the shape of the work. Here is a practical guide:

Use **senders** when:

- You need **parallel fan-out**: `when_all(s1, s2, s3)` launches concurrently.
- You want **scheduler control**: `starts_on(gpu_sched, work)` runs on GPU.
- You need **structured concurrency**: `async_scope` ensures child tasks complete.
- No dynamic allocation is needed (operation states can live on the stack).

Use **coroutines** when:

- The logic is **sequential** and would be hard to express as a pipeline.
- You want **readable control flow** with if/else, loops, try/catch.
- You're doing I/O with many suspend points (file reads, network calls).

Use **both** when:

- Sequential coroutine logic needs to co_await parallel sender work.
- A sender pipeline needs a complex step best written as a coroutine.

This combined pattern is the real sweet spot. The coroutine handles the "narrative" of what happens, while the parallel fan-out within it is expressed as senders:

```cpp
// Combining both: coroutine with parallel sender fan-out
exec::task<double> process_data() {
    // Sequential part (coroutine is natural):
    auto config = co_await load_config();  // sender

    // Parallel part (senders shine):
    auto [a, b, c] = co_await stdexec::when_all(
        fetch_from_db(config.db_url),      // sender
        fetch_from_api(config.api_url),    // sender
        compute_locally(config.data)       // sender
    );
    // All three ran concurrently!

    // Sequential again:
    co_return merge_results(a, b, c);
}
```

### Q3: The `as_awaitable` adaptor

The reason `co_await sender` works inside `exec::task` at all is the `as_awaitable` customization point. It converts any sender into an awaiter that the coroutine machinery understands. This happens automatically when you `co_await` a sender inside a task - you rarely call it yourself, but understanding what it does helps demystify the bridge.

```cpp
#include <stdexec/execution.hpp>
#include <exec/task.hpp>
#include <iostream>

// as_awaitable converts a sender into an awaitable:
// This is what exec::task does internally when you co_await a sender.

// Conceptual implementation:
template <typename Sender, typename Promise>
auto as_awaitable(Sender&& sndr, Promise& promise) {
    // 1. Deduces the value type from the sender's completion signatures
    // 2. Creates an awaiter that:
    //    - await_ready(): returns false (always suspends)
    //    - await_suspend(handle): connects sender to a receiver that
    //      resumes the coroutine on completion
    //    - await_resume(): returns the value from set_value()
    //      or rethrows from set_error()
    //      or throws operation_cancelled from set_stopped()
}

exec::task<void> example() {
    // When you write:
    int x = co_await stdexec::just(42);

    // The compiler calls:
    // auto awaiter = tag_invoke(as_awaitable, just(42), promise);
    // if (!awaiter.await_ready()) {
    //     awaiter.await_suspend(coroutine_handle);
    //     // ... suspended ...
    // }
    // int x = awaiter.await_resume();

    std::cout << x << '\n';  // 42
}
```

The bridge diagram below shows how the two worlds connect at runtime. The coroutine suspends at `co_await`, the sender runs in sender-world, and when `set_value` fires the coroutine's handle is resumed:

```cpp
Bridge diagram:

  Coroutine world          Bridge              Sender world
┌─────────────────┐                        ┌──────────────────┐
│ co_await sender  │──-> as_awaitable() ──>  │ connect(s, recv)  │
│                  │                        │ start(op_state)   │
│ ...suspended...  │                        │ ...running...     │
│                  │<── resume handle <──── │ set_value(42)     │
│ int x = 42      │                        └──────────────────┘
└─────────────────┘
```

## Notes

- `exec::task<T>` from stdexec is the recommended coroutine type for P2300 interop.
- Coroutines that co_await senders get **automatic cancellation** via stop tokens.
- Senders avoid coroutine frame heap allocations - better for latency-sensitive code.
- The `as_awaitable` customization point is ADL-discovered via `tag_invoke`.
- In C++26, `std::execution::task` will be the standard coroutine-sender bridge.
