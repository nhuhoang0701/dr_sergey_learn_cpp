## Topic Overview

By default, senders are single-shot: they can only be connected to one receiver. If you try to use the same sender in two places - say, feed its result into two different downstream pipelines - you'd normally have to run the upstream work twice. `split()` breaks that limitation. It makes a sender multi-shot by memoizing the result the first time and sharing that memoized result with every downstream consumer.

The reason this is useful: imagine the upstream sender does something expensive - a database query, a file read, an HTTP request. You want multiple parts of your program to react to that result, but you only want the expensive work to happen once. That's exactly what `split()` is for.

```cpp
Without split:              With split:

sender -> one consumer      sender -- split() -+-> consumer A
                                              +-> consumer B
                                              +-> consumer C
                             executes ONCE, result shared
```

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Share an expensive result with two pipelines

Here, `heavy_computation` should only execute once even though two independent pipelines consume its result. Calling `split()` after the expensive step is the key:

```cpp
#include <stdexec/execution.hpp>
#include <exec/static_thread_pool.hpp>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

int heavy_computation() {
    std::cout << "[expensive] Computing on thread "
              << std::this_thread::get_id() << '\n';
    return 42;
}

int main() {
    exec::static_thread_pool pool(4);
    auto sched = pool.get_scheduler();

    // Expensive computation that we want to run ONCE:
    auto expensive = stdexec::schedule(sched)
        | stdexec::then([]() { return heavy_computation(); })
        | stdexec::split();  // make it multi-shot

    // Consumer A: uses the result
    auto pipeline_a = expensive
        | stdexec::then([](int x) {
            std::cout << "Consumer A: " << x * 2 << '\n';  // 84
            return x * 2;
        });

    // Consumer B: uses the SAME result (no re-computation)
    auto pipeline_b = expensive
        | stdexec::then([](int x) {
            std::cout << "Consumer B: " << x + 10 << '\n';  // 52
            return x + 10;
        });

    // Run both consumers:
    auto combined = stdexec::when_all(
        std::move(pipeline_a),
        std::move(pipeline_b)
    );

    auto [a, b] = stdexec::sync_wait(std::move(combined)).value();
    std::cout << "A=" << a << ", B=" << b << '\n';
}
// Output:
// [expensive] Computing on thread 140001  (runs ONCE)
// Consumer A: 84
// Consumer B: 52
// A=84, B=52
```

Notice that the `[expensive]` line prints only once, even though two separate `then` steps depend on the result. That single execution is the whole purpose of `split()`.

### Q2: `split` memoizes - upstream runs only once

This example makes the single-execution guarantee explicit by counting invocations with an atomic counter. No matter how many consumers you attach, the count stays at 1:

```cpp
#include <stdexec/execution.hpp>
#include <iostream>
#include <atomic>

std::atomic<int> call_count{0};

int main() {
    auto sender = stdexec::just()
        | stdexec::then([]() {
            int n = ++call_count;  // count invocations
            std::cout << "Executed! Count: " << n << '\n';
            return 42;
        })
        | stdexec::split();  // memoize

    // Connect to 3 consumers:
    auto a = sender | stdexec::then([](int x) { return x + 1; });
    auto b = sender | stdexec::then([](int x) { return x + 2; });
    auto c = sender | stdexec::then([](int x) { return x + 3; });

    auto [ra, rb, rc] = stdexec::sync_wait(
        stdexec::when_all(
            std::move(a), std::move(b), std::move(c)
        )
    ).value();

    std::cout << "Results: " << ra << ", " << rb << ", " << rc << '\n';
    std::cout << "Call count: " << call_count.load() << '\n';
}
// Output:
// Executed! Count: 1           <-- only ONCE
// Results: 43, 44, 45
// Call count: 1
```

Three consumers, three different results based on 42, but the upstream lambda ran exactly once. That's memoization at work.

### Q3: Reference counting in `split`

Understanding *how* `split()` works under the hood helps you reason about its cost and lifetime guarantees. `split()` is the only standard sender adaptor that performs heap allocation - it has to, because the memoized result needs to outlive any individual consumer.

```cpp
Internal mechanics:

  split() creates:
  +---------------------------------+
  | Shared State (heap-allocated)    |
  |  - upstream_op_state             |
  |  - memoized_value (or error)     |
  |  - ref_count: atomic<int>        |
  |  - completion_status              |
  |  - list of waiting receivers      |
  +----------------+----------------+
                 |
  +-------------+-+-------------+
  v              v              v
  copy 1         copy 2         copy 3
  (ref_count=3)  (ref_count=3)  (ref_count=3)
  |              |              |
  connect(A)     connect(B)     connect(C)
  |              |              |
  start(A)  -- triggers upstream start (first one)
  start(B)  -- waits for memoized result
  start(C)  -- waits for memoized result
```

**Lifecycle:**

1. `split()` allocates shared state with `ref_count = 0`.
2. Each copy of the split sender increments `ref_count`.
3. First `start()` triggers the upstream sender.
4. When upstream completes, result is memoized.
5. All waiting receivers get the memoized result.
6. When last receiver completes and last copy is destroyed, shared state is freed.

The reason this allocation is unavoidable is that multiple receivers may be waiting on different threads - they all need access to the same result, and that result has to live somewhere with shared ownership. `split()` uses reference counting (similar to `shared_ptr`) to manage that lifetime safely.

```cpp
// split() is the ONLY sender adaptor that allocates heap memory.
// This is necessary because:
// 1. Multiple receivers need the same result
// 2. The result must outlive any single receiver
// 3. Thread-safe access requires shared ownership

// Without split, copying a sender and connecting it twice
// would execute the upstream work TWICE.
```

## Notes

- `split()` is the only standard sender adaptor that does heap allocation.
- The split sender is copyable (shared_ptr-like semantics).
- `ensure_started()` is similar but starts the upstream sender eagerly.
- Use `split()` when multiple consumers need the same expensive result.
- If you only need one consumer, avoid `split()` - unnecessary overhead.
