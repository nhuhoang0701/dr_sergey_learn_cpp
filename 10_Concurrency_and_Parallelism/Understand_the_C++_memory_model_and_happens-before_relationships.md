## Topic Overview

The **C++ memory model** (since C++11) defines how memory accesses behave in multi-threaded programs. It specifies when writes by one thread become visible to reads by other threads, and what constitutes undefined behavior.

### Key Relationships

```cpp

Sequenced-before (within one thread):
  A ; B  →  A is sequenced-before B (program order)

Synchronizes-with (between threads):
  Thread 1: x.store(1, release)  ─synchronizes-with─►  Thread 2: x.load(acquire)

Happens-before (transitivity):
  If A happens-before B, and B happens-before C, then A happens-before C.
  
  A seq-before B, B sync-with C, C seq-before D
  ⇒ A happens-before D

```

### Memory Orders Summary

| Order | Guarantee | Cost (x86) | Cost (ARM) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `relaxed` | Atomicity only, no ordering | Free | Free |
| `acquire` | Reads after this see all writes before paired release | Free | `ldar` |
| `release` | Writes before this are visible after paired acquire | Free | `stlr` |
| `acq_rel` | Both acquire and release | Free | `ldar`+`stlr` |
| `seq_cst` | Total order across all threads | `MFENCE` or `LOCK XCHG` | `DMB ISH` |

### Data Race = Undefined Behavior

```cpp

Two accesses to the same memory location form a DATA RACE if:

1. At least one is a WRITE
2. They are NOT ordered by happens-before
3. At least one is NOT atomic

Data race → UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR (compiler may optimize as if single-threaded)

```

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Explain what data race means in the C++ standard and why it is undefined behavior

**Answer:**

```cpp

#include <thread>
#include <iostream>

// === DATA RACE: undefined behavior ===
int shared = 0; // non-atomic

void writer() { shared = 42; }
void reader() { std::cout << shared << "\n"; }

int main() {
    std::thread t1(writer);
    std::thread t2(reader);
    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    // This is a DATA RACE:
    // - writer() writes to 'shared' (non-atomic)
    // - reader() reads from 'shared' (non-atomic)
    // - No happens-before relationship between them
    // - At least one is a write
    //
    // RESULT: Undefined Behavior. Possible outcomes:
    // 1. Prints 0 (old value)
    // 2. Prints 42 (new value)
    // 3. Prints garbage (torn read)
    // 4. Crashes
    // 5. The compiler REMOVES the read entirely (it's UB, anything goes)
    //
    // Why UB? Because the C++ abstract machine assumes:
    // "If there's no synchronization, no other thread modifies this variable."
    // The compiler optimizes based on this assumption.
    // Breaking the assumption invalidates all compiler reasoning.
}

// === NOT a data race (correctly synchronized): ===
// 1. Using atomic:
//    std::atomic<int> shared{0};  → atomic operations, not a race
//
// 2. Using mutex:
//    std::mutex m;
//    { lock_guard l(m); shared = 42; }   → happens-before via mutex
//    { lock_guard l(m); cout << shared; } → ordered after the write
//
// 3. Using join:
//    t1.join();  → thread completion happens-before join returns
//    cout << shared;  → safe if only t1 wrote to shared

```

**Common data race patterns:**

```cpp

Pattern 1: Unprotected counter
  Thread A: counter++      Thread B: counter++
  → Both read-modify-write without synchronization → UB

Pattern 2: Flag without atomic
  Thread A: done = true    Thread B: while(!done) {}
  → Compiler may hoist !done out of loop (assumes single-threaded)
  → Infinite loop even after Thread A sets done!

Pattern 3: Publishing a pointer
  Thread A: data=42; ptr=&data;   Thread B: if(ptr) use(*ptr);
  → Without release/acquire, Thread B might see ptr!=null
     but read stale data (data==0) — reordered stores

```

### Q2: Show a happens-before chain between a store and a load using acquire/release semantics

**Answer:**

```cpp

#include <atomic>
#include <thread>
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>

std::atomic<bool> ready{false};
int payload = 0; // non-atomic — safe due to happens-before

void producer() {
    // Step A: write payload (sequenced-before Step B)
    payload = 42;

    // Step B: release store on 'ready'
    ready.store(true, std::memory_order_release);
    //
    // Happens-before chain:
    // A seq-before B (within producer thread)
}

void consumer() {
    // Step C: acquire load on 'ready'
    while (!ready.load(std::memory_order_acquire))
        ;
    // B synchronizes-with C (release-acquire pair on 'ready')

    // Step D: read payload (sequenced-after Step C)
    assert(payload == 42); // GUARANTEED
    std::cout << "payload = " << payload << "\n";
    //
    // Full chain: A seq-before B sync-with C seq-before D
    // Therefore: A happens-before D
    // payload=42 is guaranteed visible at Step D
}

int main() {
    std::thread t1(producer);
    std::thread t2(consumer);
    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    std::cout << "Happens-before chain verified\n";
    // Output:
    // payload = 42
    // Happens-before chain verified
}

// === VISUAL: the happens-before chain ===
//
// Thread 1 (producer)     Thread 2 (consumer)
// ──────────────────      ──────────────────
// payload = 42            
//   │ (sequenced-before)  
//   ▼                     
// ready.store(release) ──synchronizes-with──► ready.load(acquire)
//                                               │ (sequenced-before)
//                                               ▼
//                                             assert(payload==42) ✓
//
// Chain: payload=42 → store(release) → load(acquire) → read payload
//        ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//                    HAPPENS-BEFORE (transitive)

```

### Q3: Explain why double-checked locking without atomics is broken and how to fix it

**Answer:**

```cpp

#include <atomic>
#include <mutex>
#include <thread>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

struct Expensive {
    int data[100];
    Expensive() { for (auto& d : data) d = 42; }
};

// === BROKEN: Double-checked locking without atomics ===
// (This was the standard pattern in pre-C++11 code — it's WRONG)
namespace broken {
    Expensive* instance = nullptr; // non-atomic pointer
    std::mutex mtx;

    Expensive* get() {
        if (!instance) {              // CHECK #1: no synchronization!
            std::lock_guard lock(mtx);
            if (!instance) {          // CHECK #2: under lock
                instance = new Expensive();
                // PROBLEM: compiler/CPU may reorder:
                // 1. Allocate memory
                // 2. Store pointer to instance ← other threads see non-null
                // 3. Construct object           ← but object isn't ready yet!
                //
                // Another thread sees instance != null at CHECK #1
                // but the object is half-constructed → UB
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

// === FIXED: using std::atomic with acquire/release ===
namespace fixed_atomic {
    std::atomic<Expensive*> instance{nullptr};
    std::mutex mtx;

    Expensive* get() {
        Expensive* tmp = instance.load(std::memory_order_acquire);
        // acquire: if we see non-null, we also see the complete construction

        if (!tmp) {
            std::lock_guard lock(mtx);
            tmp = instance.load(std::memory_order_relaxed); // under lock
            if (!tmp) {
                tmp = new Expensive();
                instance.store(tmp, std::memory_order_release);
                // release: construction happens-before this store
                // Other threads' acquire loads will see the
                // fully constructed object
            }
        }
        return tmp;
    }
}

// === BEST: use call_once (simplest and correct) ===
namespace best {
    std::once_flag flag;
    Expensive* instance = nullptr;

    Expensive* get() {
        std::call_once(flag, [] {
            instance = new Expensive();
        });
        return instance;
    }
}

// === SIMPLEST: Meyer's singleton (C++11 guarantees thread safety) ===
namespace simplest {
    Expensive& get() {
        static Expensive instance; // thread-safe in C++11+
        return instance;
    }
}

int main() {
    // Test all versions
    constexpr int THREADS = 8;
    std::vector<std::thread> threads;

    for (int t = 0; t < THREADS; ++t) {
        threads.emplace_back([] {
            auto* p = fixed_atomic::get();
            std::cout << "Got instance at " << p
                      << " data[0]=" << p->data[0] << "\n";
        });
    }
    for (auto& t : threads) t.join();
    // Output: All threads see the same address, data[0]=42

    delete fixed_atomic::instance.load();
}

```

**Why the broken version fails:**

```cpp

The compiler and CPU may reorder the construction sequence:

  Standard sequence:         Possible reordering:

  1. allocate memory         1. allocate memory
  2. construct object        2. store ptr (non-null now!)
  3. store ptr               3. construct object ← NOT YET DONE

  Thread A: reaches step 2 (reordered), stores non-null ptr
  Thread B: CHECK #1 sees instance != null → returns it!
  Thread B: uses half-constructed object → UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR

The fix: acquire/release ordering creates a happens-before relationship.
  store(release) ensures construction completes BEFORE the pointer is published.
  load(acquire) ensures the reading thread sees the complete object.

```

## Notes

- **The C++ memory model is hardware-agnostic.** It defines an abstract machine. The compiler maps it to hardware-specific instructions.
- **x86 is "almost" sequentially consistent:** loads have acquire semantics, stores have release semantics by default. Only store-load reordering is possible without `MFENCE`.
- **ARM/POWER are weakly ordered:** All reorderings are possible. acquire/release compile to real instructions.
- **`seq_cst` is the default** memory order for all atomic operations. It's safe but may be slower than needed.
- **Rule of thumb:** Start with `seq_cst`, profile, then weaken to `acquire`/`release` where needed and provably correct.
- **ThreadSanitizer** (`-fsanitize=thread`) detects data races at runtime. Always test concurrent code with TSan.
- Compile with `-std=c++11 -O2 -pthread -fsanitize=thread`.
