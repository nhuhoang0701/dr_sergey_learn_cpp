# Understand DRF-SC: Data-Race Freedom Implies Sequential Consistency

**Category:** Concurrency & Parallelism

## Topic Overview

The C++ memory model is intentionally weak: it allows compilers and hardware to reorder memory accesses aggressively. This creates a vast space of possible behaviours that most programmers cannot reason about. The **DRF-SC theorem** is the escape hatch: **if your program has no data races, then every execution behaves as if all operations were sequentially consistent.** You get the simplest possible mental model for free—provided you eliminate data races.

A **data race** in C++ is defined precisely: two memory accesses to the same location by different threads, where at least one is a write and they are not ordered by a *happens-before* relationship. This is **undefined behaviour**—not just non-determinism, but UB that permits the compiler to assume it never happens and optimize accordingly. The DRF-SC guarantee therefore says: eliminate UB, and the remaining nondeterminism (interleaving order) is the only complexity you face.

| Concept | Definition | How to Achieve |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Happens-before** | Transitive closure of *sequenced-before* and *synchronizes-with* | Use mutexes, atomics, `std::call_once`, etc. |
| **Synchronizes-with** | A release operation that pairs with an acquire on the same atomic | `store(release)` ↔ `load(acquire)`, `unlock` ↔ `lock` |
| **Data race** | Conflicting, unordered accesses (at least one write) to a non-atomic | Bug: UB |
| **DRF-SC** | No data races → program behaves as-if sequentially consistent | All shared mutable state accessed under proper synchronisation |

```

The practical implication is a **two-tier approach**: write the vast majority of your concurrent code using mutexes, condition variables, and `seq_cst` atomics—all of which establish happens-before edges and prevent data races. Only descend to weaker orderings (`acquire`/`release`, `relaxed`) in performance-critical sections where you can formally prove correctness. DRF-SC guarantees that the simple code path is correct without reasoning about hardware memory models.

Why does this matter for real code? Because **compilers exploit the absence of data races**. If the compiler can prove a non-atomic variable is not accessed concurrently, it can cache it in a register, reorder it across calls, or eliminate it entirely. A data race doesn't just give you a "wrong value"—it can cause the compiler to generate code that loops infinitely, skips branches, or corrupts unrelated memory.

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Demonstrate a data race and show how adding proper synchronisation restores sequentially-consistent behaviour

```cpp

// Compile: g++ -std=c++20 -pthread -fsanitize=thread q1_drf_sc.cpp -o q1
// Run with ThreadSanitizer to detect the race in the first version.
#include <atomic>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

// ============ VERSION 1: DATA RACE (UB) ============
namespace racy {
    int x = 0;       // non-atomic, shared
    int y = 0;       // non-atomic, shared
    int r1 = 0, r2 = 0;

    void thread_a() {
        x = 1;        // W(x)
        r1 = y;       // R(y)
    }
    void thread_b() {
        y = 1;        // W(y)
        r2 = x;       // R(x)
    }
    // Both x and y have conflicting accesses with no happens-before.
    // Result r1 == 0 && r2 == 0 is possible under UB—and compilers
    // may actually produce it via store-buffer forwarding or reordering.
}

// ============ VERSION 2: DRF via seq_cst atomics ============
namespace drf {
    std::atomic<int> x{0};
    std::atomic<int> y{0};
    int r1 = 0, r2 = 0;

    void thread_a() {
        x.store(1, std::memory_order_seq_cst);    // W(x)
        r1 = y.load(std::memory_order_seq_cst);   // R(y)
    }
    void thread_b() {
        y.store(1, std::memory_order_seq_cst);     // W(y)
        r2 = x.load(std::memory_order_seq_cst);    // R(x)
    }
    // DRF-SC guarantees: at least one of r1, r2 must be 1.
    // The outcome r1 == 0 && r2 == 0 is impossible.
}

int main() {
    // Run the DRF version many times to confirm the invariant
    int both_zero = 0;
    constexpr int ITERS = 1'000'000;

    for (int i = 0; i < ITERS; ++i) {
        drf::x = 0;
        drf::y = 0;
        drf::r1 = 0;
        drf::r2 = 0;

        std::thread a(drf::thread_a);
        std::thread b(drf::thread_b);
        a.join();
        b.join();

        if (drf::r1 == 0 && drf::r2 == 0)
            ++both_zero;
    }

    std::cout << "DRF version: r1==0 && r2==0 occurred "
              << both_zero << " / " << ITERS << " times\n";
    // Expected: 0 / 1000000
    return 0;
}

```

**Key insight:** The racy version has UB—the compiler and hardware may produce any result. The DRF version uses `seq_cst` atomics, which establish happens-before edges. DRF-SC guarantees the program behaves as if all operations execute in some single total order, making `r1 == 0 && r2 == 0` impossible.

---

### Q2: Show that `acquire`/`release` atomics also provide DRF-SC for the protected non-atomic data—not just for the atomics themselves

```cpp

// Compile: g++ -std=c++20 -pthread q2_acq_rel_drf.cpp -o q2
#include <atomic>
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

struct Payload {
    int a = 0;
    int b = 0;
    int c = 0;
};

Payload data;                          // non-atomic shared state
std::atomic<bool> ready{false};        // synchronisation flag

void producer() {
    // These writes to non-atomic `data` happen-before the release store
    data.a = 42;
    data.b = 100;
    data.c = data.a + data.b;
    ready.store(true, std::memory_order_release);  // ← release
}

void consumer() {
    while (!ready.load(std::memory_order_acquire))  // ← acquire
        ;  // spin

    // The acquire-load synchronizes-with the release-store.
    // All writes sequenced-before the release in the producer
    // happen-before all reads sequenced-after the acquire here.
    // Therefore, these reads of non-atomic data are NOT a data race.
    assert(data.a == 42);
    assert(data.b == 100);
    assert(data.c == 142);
    std::cout << "All assertions passed: data is consistent.\n";
}

int main() {
    std::thread t1(producer);
    std::thread t2(consumer);
    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    return 0;
}

```

**Key insight:** DRF-SC does not require `seq_cst` everywhere. Any mechanism that creates happens-before edges—including `acquire`/`release`—suffices to make non-atomic accesses race-free. Once race-free, the program behaves sequentially consistently. The weaker ordering only affects how atomics interact with *each other* when multiple atomics are in play (no single total order guarantee).

---

### Q3: Illustrate a subtle case where `relaxed` atomics do NOT cause a data race but still permit non-sequentially-consistent outcomes for the atomics themselves

```cpp

// Compile: g++ -std=c++20 -pthread q3_relaxed_non_sc.cpp -o q3
#include <atomic>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

// Store-buffer litmus test with relaxed atomics
std::atomic<int> x{0}, y{0};
int r1 = 0, r2 = 0;

void thread_a() {
    x.store(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);
    r1 = y.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);
}

void thread_b() {
    y.store(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);
    r2 = x.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);
}

int main() {
    int both_zero = 0;
    constexpr int ITERS = 1'000'000;

    for (int i = 0; i < ITERS; ++i) {
        x.store(0, std::memory_order_relaxed);
        y.store(0, std::memory_order_relaxed);
        r1 = 0;
        r2 = 0;

        std::thread a(thread_a);
        std::thread b(thread_b);
        a.join();
        b.join();

        if (r1 == 0 && r2 == 0)
            ++both_zero;
    }

    std::cout << "Relaxed atomics: r1==0 && r2==0 occurred "
              << both_zero << " / " << ITERS << " times\n";
    // On x86: likely 0 (TSO hides this). On ARM/POWER: likely > 0.
    // This is NOT a data race (atomics are never races), but it IS
    // a non-sequentially-consistent outcome. DRF-SC does not apply
    // to the ordering of atomic operations themselves under relaxed.

    std::cout << "\nNote: No data race exists (all accesses are atomic).\n"
              << "But DRF-SC guarantees SC behaviour for NON-ATOMIC data\n"
              << "only. Atomic operations under relaxed ordering can still\n"
              << "exhibit non-SC interleavings.\n";

    return 0;
}

```

**Key insight:** DRF-SC says "if there are no data races on non-atomic objects, the program behaves as-if sequentially consistent." Atomic accesses **by definition** cannot be data races (they are always well-defined). Therefore, DRF-SC does not constrain the ordering of relaxed atomic operations—they can exhibit non-SC outcomes. The guarantee applies to the *non-atomic* world: if you protect all non-atomics properly, those reads and writes behave as-if SC.

---

## Notes

- **DRF-SC is a contract:** you eliminate data races, and the compiler/hardware gives you SC semantics for non-atomic accesses. Break the contract (introduce a race) and you get UB, not just weak ordering.
- **ThreadSanitizer** (`-fsanitize=thread`) is the best practical tool for verifying DRF. It dynamically detects happens-before violations. Use it in CI.
- **`volatile` does not prevent data races.** In C++, `volatile` has no threading semantics. Only `std::atomic` and synchronisation primitives create happens-before edges.
- **Benign races don't exist in C++.** Unlike Java (which has a weaker guarantee), C++ treats every data race as UB. Even "benign" patterns like racy counters or double-checked locking without atomics are formally UB and can miscompile.
- **DRF-SC across standards:** The guarantee has been part of C++ since C++11. C++20 and C++23 added new synchronisation primitives (barriers, latches, `osyncstream`) but the fundamental DRF-SC theorem is unchanged.
- **Compiler fences** (`std::atomic_thread_fence`) also establish happens-before edges and can be used to achieve DRF without per-variable atomic types, though this is an advanced technique.
