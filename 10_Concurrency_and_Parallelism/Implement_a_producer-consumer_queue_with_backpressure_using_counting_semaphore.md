## Topic Overview

A **bounded producer-consumer queue** limits how many items can be buffered at once, which creates **backpressure**: when the buffer is full, producers are forced to wait rather than consuming unbounded memory. This is a critical property for any long-running system where producers can outpace consumers. Without it, a temporarily slow consumer can cause the queue to grow until the process runs out of memory.

C++20's `std::counting_semaphore` is the ideal primitive for this pattern. The trick is to use two semaphores that together track the queue's state: one counting how many empty slots are available (producers need a slot before they can push), and one counting how many filled slots are available (consumers need an item before they can pop).

### Architecture

```cpp
Producer threads                              Consumer threads
     |                                             ^
     v                                             |
 empty_slots.acquire()  -> blocks if 0 slots     full_slots.acquire() -> blocks if 0 items
     |                                             |
  [ mutex: enqueue item ]                    [ mutex: dequeue item ]
     |                                             |
 full_slots.release()   -> signals consumer     empty_slots.release() -> signals producer
```

### Two Semaphores Pattern

| Semaphore | Initial value | acquire() means | release() means |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `empty_slots` | N (capacity) | "Take a slot" (producer) | "Return a slot" (consumer) |
| `full_slots` | 0 | "Take an item" (consumer) | "Signal new item" (producer) |

The invariant maintained at all times is: `empty_slots + full_slots = Capacity`. Every push atomically converts one empty slot into one full slot; every pop converts one full slot back into one empty slot.

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Use a counting_semaphore to block producers when the queue is full and consumers when empty

**Answer:**

The implementation is clean and symmetric - each side mirrors the other. Notice that the semaphore acquire/release is done outside the mutex lock, which keeps the critical section as short as possible:

```cpp
#include <semaphore>
#include <mutex>
#include <queue>
#include <thread>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

template<typename T, int Capacity>
class BoundedQueue {
    std::queue<T> queue_;
    std::mutex mtx_;
    std::counting_semaphore<Capacity> empty_slots_{Capacity}; // starts full
    std::counting_semaphore<Capacity> full_slots_{0};          // starts empty

public:
    void push(T item) {
        empty_slots_.acquire(); // blocks if no empty slots (queue full)

        {
            std::lock_guard lock(mtx_);
            queue_.push(std::move(item));
        }

        full_slots_.release(); // signal: one more item available
    }

    T pop() {
        full_slots_.acquire(); // blocks if no items (queue empty)

        T item;
        {
            std::lock_guard lock(mtx_);
            item = std::move(queue_.front());
            queue_.pop();
        }

        empty_slots_.release(); // signal: one more slot available
        return item;
    }
};

int main() {
    BoundedQueue<int, 4> queue; // capacity = 4

    // Producer: produces 10 items
    std::thread producer([&] {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
            queue.push(i);
            std::cout << "Produced: " << i << "\n";
        }
    });

    // Consumer: consumes 10 items (with simulated slow processing)
    std::thread consumer([&] {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
            int val = queue.pop();
            std::cout << "Consumed: " << val << "\n";
        }
    });

    producer.join();
    consumer.join();
    // Producer blocks after 4 items until consumer catches up (backpressure!)
}
```

The producer acquires `empty_slots` before enqueuing. When 4 items are buffered and none consumed, `empty_slots` reaches 0 and the producer blocks. The consumer acquires `full_slots` before dequeuing - if the queue is empty, it blocks. Each side releases the other's semaphore after its operation, maintaining the invariant that `empty_slots + full_slots = Capacity` at all times.

### Q2: Show the difference between a bounded queue (backpressure) and an unbounded queue (memory growth)

**Answer:**

This benchmark makes the memory risk concrete. With a fast producer and a slow consumer, an unbounded queue grows to nearly the full producer output while the consumer is still working its way through:

```cpp
#include <queue>
#include <mutex>
#include <thread>
#include <iostream>
#include <chrono>
#include <semaphore>
#include <condition_variable>

// === UNBOUNDED queue: no backpressure ===
template<typename T>
class UnboundedQueue {
    std::queue<T> queue_;
    std::mutex mtx_;
    std::condition_variable cv_;
public:
    void push(T item) {
        // NEVER blocks - always accepts items
        std::lock_guard lock(mtx_);
        queue_.push(std::move(item));
        cv_.notify_one();
    }

    T pop() {
        std::unique_lock lock(mtx_);
        cv_.wait(lock, [&] { return !queue_.empty(); });
        T item = std::move(queue_.front());
        queue_.pop();
        return item;
    }

    size_t size() {
        std::lock_guard lock(mtx_);
        return queue_.size();
    }
};

int main() {
    // Scenario: fast producer, slow consumer

    // --- Unbounded: memory grows without limit ---
    UnboundedQueue<int> unbounded;
    std::thread fast_producer([&] {
        for (int i = 0; i < 100'000; ++i)
            unbounded.push(i); // never blocks
    });
    std::thread slow_consumer([&] {
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
            unbounded.pop();
            std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::microseconds(10));
        }
    });

    fast_producer.join();
    std::cout << "Unbounded queue size: " << unbounded.size() << "\n";
    // Output: ~99000 - almost everything buffered in memory!
    // In production: OOM killer would eventually terminate the process

    slow_consumer.detach(); // let it drain (simplified for demo)

    // --- Bounded (backpressure): memory stays constant ---
    // Using the BoundedQueue from Q1 with capacity 100:
    // - Producer blocks after 100 items until consumer catches up
    // - Queue size NEVER exceeds 100
    // - Memory usage is bounded and predictable

    // COMPARISON:
    // +--------------+-------------------+--------------------+
    // |              | Unbounded         | Bounded            |
    // +--------------+-------------------+--------------------+
    // | Memory       | O(produced-consumed)| O(capacity)      |
    // | Producer     | Never blocks      | Blocks when full   |
    // | Latency      | Grows over time   | Bounded            |
    // | OOM risk     | YES               | No                 |
    // | Use case     | Bursty, big memory| Steady, controlled |
    // +--------------+-------------------+--------------------+

    std::cout << "Bounded queues prevent runaway memory growth\n";
}
```

An unbounded queue lets the producer run at full speed, buffering potentially millions of items in memory when the consumer is slow. A bounded queue with backpressure limits the buffer to a fixed capacity - the producer is forced to slow down to the consumer's rate, preventing memory exhaustion and keeping end-to-end latency bounded and predictable.

### Q3: Implement a multi-producer multi-consumer bounded queue and verify correctness under stress

**Answer:**

Scaling from a single producer/consumer pair to multiple on each side does not require changing the semaphore logic at all - the semaphore handles the coordination automatically. The stress test verifies correctness by checking that the sum of all consumed values exactly matches the sum of all produced values:

```cpp
#include <semaphore>
#include <mutex>
#include <queue>
#include <thread>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <atomic>
#include <cassert>

template<typename T, int Capacity>
class MPMCQueue {
    std::queue<T> queue_;
    std::mutex mtx_;
    std::counting_semaphore<Capacity> empty_slots_{Capacity};
    std::counting_semaphore<Capacity> full_slots_{0};

public:
    void push(T item) {
        empty_slots_.acquire();
        {
            std::lock_guard lock(mtx_);
            queue_.push(std::move(item));
        }
        full_slots_.release();
    }

    T pop() {
        full_slots_.acquire();
        T item;
        {
            std::lock_guard lock(mtx_);
            item = std::move(queue_.front());
            queue_.pop();
        }
        empty_slots_.release();
        return item;
    }
};

int main() {
    constexpr int NUM_PRODUCERS = 4;
    constexpr int NUM_CONSUMERS = 4;
    constexpr int ITEMS_PER_PRODUCER = 100'000;
    constexpr int TOTAL_ITEMS = NUM_PRODUCERS * ITEMS_PER_PRODUCER;

    MPMCQueue<int, 256> queue;
    std::atomic<long long> produced_sum{0};
    std::atomic<long long> consumed_sum{0};
    std::atomic<int> consumed_count{0};

    // === Producers ===
    std::vector<std::thread> producers;
    for (int p = 0; p < NUM_PRODUCERS; ++p) {
        producers.emplace_back([&, p] {
            for (int i = 0; i < ITEMS_PER_PRODUCER; ++i) {
                int val = p * ITEMS_PER_PRODUCER + i;
                queue.push(val);
                produced_sum.fetch_add(val, std::memory_order_relaxed);
            }
        });
    }

    // === Consumers ===
    std::vector<std::thread> consumers;
    for (int c = 0; c < NUM_CONSUMERS; ++c) {
        consumers.emplace_back([&] {
            while (true) {
                int count = consumed_count.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_acq_rel);
                if (count >= TOTAL_ITEMS) break;

                int val = queue.pop();
                consumed_sum.fetch_add(val, std::memory_order_relaxed);
            }
        });
    }

    for (auto& t : producers) t.join();
    for (auto& t : consumers) t.join();

    // === Verify correctness ===
    std::cout << "Produced sum: " << produced_sum.load() << "\n";
    std::cout << "Consumed sum: " << consumed_sum.load() << "\n";
    std::cout << "Match: " << std::boolalpha
              << (produced_sum.load() == consumed_sum.load()) << "\n";
    // Output: Match: true

    // Correctness guarantees:
    // 1. No item is lost (sum matches)
    // 2. No item is duplicated (count exactly TOTAL_ITEMS)
    // 3. Queue never exceeds capacity (semaphore enforces)
    // 4. No deadlock (producers and consumers always make progress)
}
```

The MPMC queue uses `counting_semaphore` for flow control and `std::mutex` for the critical section. The stress test verifies that the sum of all produced values exactly matches the sum of all consumed values, proving no items are lost or duplicated under heavy concurrent load. The 256-item capacity ensures bounded memory regardless of production/consumption rate imbalance.

## Notes

- Semaphore vs condition_variable: Semaphores encode the count directly, so there is no need for a separate counter and predicate check. They are often more efficient and clearer for producer-consumer patterns.
- `binary_semaphore` is `counting_semaphore<1>` - useful for simple signaling between two threads.
- Capacity tuning: Too small means producers block frequently. Too large means high memory usage and latency. Profile your workload to find the sweet spot.
- Ring buffer alternative: For maximum performance, replace `std::queue` plus mutex with a pre-allocated ring buffer and atomic indices - this avoids dynamic allocation and reduces the critical section size.
- Compile with `-std=c++20 -pthread`.
