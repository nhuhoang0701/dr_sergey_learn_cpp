## Topic Overview

A **memory fence** (barrier) is an ordering constraint that applies to *all* memory operations across it, not just a single atomic variable. `std::atomic_thread_fence` enforces ordering between relaxed (or unordered) accesses without being tied to any specific atomic object.

### Fence vs Per-Variable Memory Order

```cpp

Per-variable order:                    Fence:
  x.store(1, release);                  x.store(1, relaxed);
  // orders THIS store                  atomic_thread_fence(release);
  // relative to                        y.store(1, relaxed);
  // prior operations                   // orders ALL prior stores
                                        // relative to ALL subsequent stores

```

### Fence Types

| Fence | Effect | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `acquire` | Prevents reads/writes AFTER the fence from moving BEFORE it | Consumer side: read flag, fence, read data |
| `release` | Prevents reads/writes BEFORE the fence from moving AFTER it | Producer side: write data, fence, write flag |
| `acq_rel` | Both acquire and release | Read-modify-write patterns |
| `seq_cst` | Total order across all threads | Rarely needed with fences |

### When Fences Are Useful

- **Batching:** One fence can order multiple relaxed operations (cheaper than per-operation ordering on some architectures)
- **Separation of concerns:** Data access code uses relaxed; synchronization logic adds fences
- **Legacy/hardware interop:** Maps directly to hardware fence instructions

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Show that atomic_thread_fence(acquire) applies to all prior relaxed loads in the current thread

**Answer:**

```cpp

#include <atomic>
#include <thread>
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>

// A fence applies to ALL memory operations, not just one variable
std::atomic<int> flag{0};
int data1 = 0;  // non-atomic
int data2 = 0;  // non-atomic
int data3 = 0;  // non-atomic

void producer() {
    // Write multiple pieces of data
    data1 = 10;
    data2 = 20;
    data3 = 30;

    // Release fence: ensures ALL stores above are visible
    // before the flag store below
    std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_release);

    flag.store(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);
    //         ^^^^^^^ relaxed is sufficient — the fence does the ordering
}

void consumer() {
    // Spin until we see the flag
    while (flag.load(std::memory_order_relaxed) != 1)
        ;
    //   ^^^^^^^ relaxed — fence below handles ordering

    // Acquire fence: ensures ALL loads below see the stores
    // that happened before the producer's release fence
    std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_acquire);

    // ALL three non-atomic reads are guaranteed to see
    // the producer's writes (data1=10, data2=20, data3=30)
    assert(data1 == 10);  // guaranteed
    assert(data2 == 20);  // guaranteed
    assert(data3 == 30);  // guaranteed
    std::cout << "All data visible: " << data1 << ", "
              << data2 << ", " << data3 << "\n";
    // Output: All data visible: 10, 20, 30
}

int main() {
    std::thread t1(producer);
    std::thread t2(consumer);
    t1.join();
    t2.join();

    // === KEY DIFFERENCE FROM PER-VARIABLE ORDER ===
    //
    // With per-variable order, you'd need:
    //   flag.store(1, memory_order_release);  // orders only stores BEFORE this store
    //   flag.load(memory_order_acquire);       // orders only loads AFTER this load
    //
    // This is EQUIVALENT for one flag variable. But with a FENCE:
    //   All relaxed stores before the release fence are ordered
    //   All relaxed loads after the acquire fence are ordered
    //   This includes stores/loads to OTHER atomic variables!
    //
    // Proof: if we had flag2, flag3, etc., a single fence
    // would cover ALL of them, whereas per-variable ordering
    // would need acquire/release on EACH variable.
}

```

**Explanation:** The release fence orders *all* prior stores (data1, data2, data3) relative to the subsequent relaxed store of the flag. The acquire fence orders *all* subsequent loads relative to the prior relaxed load of the flag. One fence covers multiple variables — this is the key advantage over per-variable memory ordering.

### Q2: Explain the difference between a fence and an acquire load on a single atomic variable

**Answer:**

```cpp

Acquire LOAD on a variable:           Acquire FENCE:
─────────────────────────────         ─────────────────
auto val = x.load(acquire);           auto val = x.load(relaxed);
// Only operations AFTER this         auto y = flag.load(relaxed);
// load are ordered with              atomic_thread_fence(acquire);
// respect to THIS load of x.         // ALL operations below are
// Does NOT affect other              // ordered with respect to
// atomic variables.                  // ALL relaxed loads above.

┌─────────────────────┐               ┌─────────────────────┐
│ x.load(acquire)     │               │ x.load(relaxed)     │
│                     │               │ y.load(relaxed)      │
│ ══════barrier═══════│               │ z.load(relaxed)      │
│ ↓ ops after HERE    │               │ ══════barrier════════│
│   are ordered       │               │ ↓ ALL ops below      │
│   w.r.t. x only    │               │   are ordered w.r.t. │
└─────────────────────┘               │   ALL loads above    │
                                      └─────────────────────┘

```

**Key differences:**

| Aspect | Acquire load (`x.load(acquire)`) | Acquire fence (`atomic_thread_fence(acquire)`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scope | Orders only w.r.t. `x` | Orders w.r.t. ALL prior relaxed loads |
| Performance | Often free on x86 (loads are acquire by default) | Explicit barrier instruction on ARM |
| Use case | Single synchronization variable | Multiple atomic variables need ordering |
| Composability | One per variable | One fence covers everything |

**When to use a fence:** When you have multiple atomic variables that all need acquire/release semantics, a single fence is simpler and potentially cheaper than putting `memory_order_acquire` on each load individually.

**When per-variable is better:** When you synchronize on just one variable (the common case), per-variable ordering is clearer and has zero extra cost on x86.

### Q3: Write a lock implementation using only fences and atomic_flag for educational purposes

**Answer:**

```cpp

#include <atomic>
#include <thread>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class FenceSpinLock {
    std::atomic_flag locked_ = ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT; // false initially

public:
    void lock() {
        // Spin until we successfully set the flag
        while (locked_.test_and_set(std::memory_order_relaxed)) {
            // busy wait — flag was already set (someone else holds the lock)
        }
        // We acquired the lock (test_and_set returned false = was unlocked)

        // ACQUIRE fence: ensures all memory operations AFTER this point
        // see the stores made by the previous lock holder before their
        // release fence
        std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_acquire);
    }

    void unlock() {
        // RELEASE fence: ensures all memory operations BEFORE this point
        // are visible to the next thread that acquires the lock
        std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_release);

        // Clear the flag — lock is now available
        locked_.clear(std::memory_order_relaxed);
        // relaxed is fine — the fence above already ordered everything
    }
};

// === Test: protect shared data ===
FenceSpinLock spin;
int shared_counter = 0; // non-atomic, protected by spinlock

void increment(int times) {
    for (int i = 0; i < times; ++i) {
        spin.lock();
        ++shared_counter; // safe: only one thread at a time
        spin.unlock();
    }
}

int main() {
    constexpr int THREADS = 8;
    constexpr int ITERS = 100'000;

    std::vector<std::thread> threads;
    for (int t = 0; t < THREADS; ++t)
        threads.emplace_back(increment, ITERS);
    for (auto& t : threads) t.join();

    std::cout << "Counter: " << shared_counter << "\n";
    std::cout << "Expected: " << THREADS * ITERS << "\n";
    // Output:
    // Counter: 800000
    // Expected: 800000

    // === EQUIVALENT without fences (per-operation ordering): ===
    // lock:   while (flag.test_and_set(memory_order_acquire)) {}
    // unlock: flag.clear(memory_order_release);
    //
    // The fence version separates the ordering concern from the
    // atomic operation, which can be useful when the lock protects
    // multiple data structures (the fence covers everything).
}

```

**Explanation:** The acquire fence after `test_and_set` ensures all subsequent reads in the critical section see the previous holder's writes. The release fence before `clear` ensures all writes in the critical section are visible to the next acquirer. Using fences with relaxed atomics is equivalent to using acquire/release on the atomic operations directly.

## Notes

- **On x86:** Fences often compile to no-ops because x86 has a strong memory model (loads are acquire, stores are release by default). Only `seq_cst` fences emit `MFENCE`.
- **On ARM/POWER:** Fences compile to `DMB` (ARM) or `LWSYNC`/`HWSYNC` (POWER) instructions — real cost.
- **`std::atomic_thread_fence` vs `std::atomic_signal_fence`:** Thread fences order between threads; signal fences order between a thread and a signal handler in the same thread.
- **Rule of thumb:** Prefer per-variable ordering (`load(acquire)`, `store(release)`) for clarity. Use fences when you need to batch ordering across multiple variables.
- Compile with `-std=c++11 -O2 -pthread`.
