## Topic Overview

### The Problem: Partial Construction Leaks

When a constructor acquires multiple resources (memory, file handles, locks, etc.), an exception during the second acquisition leaves the first resource leaked. This is one of those bugs that is easy to write and surprisingly hard to notice. C++ guarantees that **the destructor is NOT called for a partially constructed object**, so you cannot rely on your cleanup code running at all.

### Why Destructors Don't Run on Partial Construction

The reason this trips people up is that C++ defines an object's existence as beginning only when its constructor *completes successfully*. If the constructor throws partway through, the object never fully existed, and the runtime will not call its destructor. What it *will* do is destroy any subobjects (base classes and members) that were already fully constructed. Here is the sequence in plain terms:

```cpp
Constructor of MyClass begins:

  1. Base class constructors run          <- these get destroyed if throw happens later
  2. Member initializers run in order     <- already-constructed members get destroyed
  3. Constructor body executes            <- if throw happens here, members ARE destroyed

                                            but ~MyClass() is NOT called
```

So the question becomes: who cleans up resource 1 if resource 2's acquisition throws? The answer is: nobody, unless resource 1 is itself wrapped in an RAII object whose destructor the runtime will call automatically.

### The Fix: RAII Members

If each resource is wrapped in its own RAII object (smart pointer, file handle wrapper, etc.), then partially-constructed members that were fully initialized **will** have their destructors called. That is enough - it means the cleanup happens automatically even when the constructor throws.

```cpp
class Safe {
    std::unique_ptr<int[]> buf1_;   // RAII member 1
    std::unique_ptr<int[]> buf2_;   // RAII member 2
public:
    Safe()
        : buf1_(new int[1000])      // if this succeeds...
        , buf2_(new int[1000])      // ...and this throws,
    {}                               // buf1_'s destructor runs automatically!
};
```

The key insight is that `buf1_` is a fully-constructed `unique_ptr` by the time `buf2_`'s initialization starts, so the runtime will call `buf1_`'s destructor if the constructor throws.

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Show a constructor that acquires two resources and leaks the first if the second acquisition throws

Here we deliberately write the buggy version to see what goes wrong. Notice that `r1_` and `r2_` are raw pointers - there is nothing the runtime can automatically call to free them.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cstring>

// Simulated resource
struct Resource {
    int id;
    Resource(int i) : id(i) {
        std::cout << "  Resource " << id << " acquired\n";
    }
    ~Resource() {
        std::cout << "  Resource " << id << " released\n";
    }
};

// BUGGY: manages two resources with raw pointers
class Leaky {
    Resource* r1_;
    Resource* r2_;
public:
    Leaky(bool second_fails) : r1_(nullptr), r2_(nullptr) {
        r1_ = new Resource(1);       // Acquire first resource

        if (second_fails) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Second resource failed!");
            // r1_ is LEAKED! Destructor won't be called because
            // the object was never fully constructed.
        }

        r2_ = new Resource(2);       // Acquire second resource
    }

    ~Leaky() {
        std::cout << "  ~Leaky() called\n";
        delete r2_;
        delete r1_;
    }
};

int main() {
    std::cout << "=== Case 1: No failure ===\n";
    {
        Leaky ok(false);
    }  // destructor runs, both resources released

    std::cout << "\n=== Case 2: Second resource fails ===\n";
    try {
        Leaky bad(true);  // throws during construction
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cout << "  Caught: " << e.what() << "\n";
        // ~Leaky() was NEVER called!
        // Resource 1 is LEAKED!
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```text
=== Case 1: No failure ===
  Resource 1 acquired
  Resource 2 acquired
  ~Leaky() called
  Resource 2 released
  Resource 1 released

=== Case 2: Second resource fails ===
  Resource 1 acquired
  Caught: Second resource failed!
```

Notice that in Case 2 there is no "Resource 1 released" line - it leaked. `~Leaky()` was never called because the object never fully existed, and the raw pointer `r1_` had no RAII destructor to rely on.

### Q2: Fix it using RAII wrappers for each resource so the destructor cleans up on partial construction

The fix is to change `r1_` and `r2_` from raw pointers to `unique_ptr`. Once `r1_`'s `unique_ptr` is fully constructed, the runtime owns responsibility for destroying it - even if the constructor throws later.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <stdexcept>

// Same resource type
struct Resource {
    int id;
    Resource(int i) : id(i) {
        std::cout << "  Resource " << id << " acquired\n";
    }
    ~Resource() {
        std::cout << "  Resource " << id << " released\n";
    }
};

// FIXED: use unique_ptr for each resource
class Safe {
    std::unique_ptr<Resource> r1_;
    std::unique_ptr<Resource> r2_;
public:
    Safe(bool second_fails)
        : r1_(std::make_unique<Resource>(1))   // Acquire first
        , r2_(second_fails ? throw std::runtime_error("Second resource failed!"),
                             std::unique_ptr<Resource>()
                           : std::make_unique<Resource>(2))  // Acquire second
    {
        // Note: the above ternary is unwieldy - usually you'd do:
    }

    ~Safe() {
        std::cout << "  ~Safe() called\n";
    }
};

// Cleaner version using constructor body
class SafeV2 {
    std::unique_ptr<Resource> r1_;
    std::unique_ptr<Resource> r2_;
public:
    SafeV2(bool second_fails) {
        r1_ = std::make_unique<Resource>(1);

        if (second_fails) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Second resource failed!");
            // r1_ is a fully-constructed unique_ptr member, so its
            // destructor WILL be called, releasing Resource 1!
        }

        r2_ = std::make_unique<Resource>(2);
    }

    ~SafeV2() {
        std::cout << "  ~SafeV2() called\n";
    }
};

// Also applicable to non-memory resources via custom deleters
struct FileHandle {
    FILE* fp;
    FileHandle(const char* path) : fp(fopen(path, "w")) {
        if (!fp) throw std::runtime_error("Can't open file");
        std::cout << "  File opened\n";
    }
    ~FileHandle() {
        if (fp) { fclose(fp); std::cout << "  File closed\n"; }
    }
};

class MultiResource {
    std::unique_ptr<Resource> res_;
    FileHandle file_;
public:
    MultiResource(const char* path, bool fail_after_file)
        : res_(std::make_unique<Resource>(1))  // if this succeeds...
        , file_(path)                           // and this succeeds...
    {
        if (fail_after_file) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Late failure");
            // Both res_ and file_ destructors run!
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    std::cout << "=== SafeV2: No failure ===\n";
    {
        SafeV2 ok(false);
    }

    std::cout << "\n=== SafeV2: Second fails ===\n";
    try {
        SafeV2 bad(true);
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cout << "  Caught: " << e.what() << "\n";
        // Resource 1 IS properly released because unique_ptr destructor runs!
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```text
=== SafeV2: No failure ===
  Resource 1 acquired
  Resource 2 acquired
  ~SafeV2() called
  Resource 2 released
  Resource 1 released

=== SafeV2: Second fails ===
  Resource 1 acquired
  Caught: Second resource failed!
  Resource 1 released
```

This time "Resource 1 released" appears even in the failure case. The `unique_ptr` member was fully constructed before the throw, so the runtime called its destructor and the resource was freed properly.

### Q3: Explain why partially constructed objects do not have their destructor called

The C++ standard defines an object's lifetime as beginning when its constructor **completes successfully**. If the constructor throws, here is exactly what gets cleaned up and what does not:

| What happens | Destructor called? |
| --- | --- |
| Base class subobjects (already constructed) | **Yes** - in reverse order |
| Member subobjects (already constructed) | **Yes** - in reverse declaration order |
| The object itself (~MyClass) | **No** - it never existed |
| Array elements (partially constructed array) | **Yes** for completed elements |

This example makes the sequence concrete. Watch the output to see exactly which destructors run and which do not.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>

struct Base {
    Base()  { std::cout << "  Base()\n"; }
    ~Base() { std::cout << "  ~Base()\n"; }
};

struct MemberA {
    MemberA()  { std::cout << "  MemberA()\n"; }
    ~MemberA() { std::cout << "  ~MemberA()\n"; }
};

struct MemberB {
    MemberB()  { std::cout << "  MemberB()\n"; }
    ~MemberB() { std::cout << "  ~MemberB()\n"; }
};

struct MemberC {
    MemberC()  { std::cout << "  MemberC() - THROWS!\n"; throw std::runtime_error("fail"); }
    ~MemberC() { std::cout << "  ~MemberC()\n"; }
};

class MyClass : public Base {
    MemberA a_;
    MemberB b_;
    MemberC c_;   // throws during construction
public:
    MyClass() {
        std::cout << "  MyClass body (never reached)\n";
    }
    ~MyClass() {
        std::cout << "  ~MyClass() (never called)\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    std::cout << "=== Construction attempt ===\n";
    try {
        MyClass obj;
    } catch (...) {
        std::cout << "  Exception caught\n";
    }

    // What we observe:
    // 1. Base() constructed
    // 2. MemberA() constructed
    // 3. MemberB() constructed
    // 4. MemberC() throws
    // 5. ~MemberB() called (reverse order)
    // 6. ~MemberA() called
    // 7. ~Base() called
    // 8. ~MyClass() NOT called (object never fully existed)

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```text
=== Construction attempt ===
  Base()
  MemberA()
  MemberB()
  MemberC() - THROWS!
  ~MemberB()
  ~MemberA()
  ~Base()
  Exception caught
```

Notice that `~MemberC()` does not appear - MemberC's constructor threw, so MemberC was never fully constructed. `~MyClass()` also does not appear. But `~MemberB()` and `~MemberA()` do appear because those members were fully constructed before the throw. This is exactly why each resource must be its own RAII wrapper - the wrapper's destructor will run even during partial construction.

**Rules:**

1. **The object's destructor is never called** because the object's lifetime never began.
2. **Already-constructed subobjects ARE destroyed** in reverse order of construction.
3. This is why **each resource must be its own RAII wrapper** - the wrapper's destructor WILL run even during partial construction.

## Notes

- The function-try-block (`try`/`catch` around the entire constructor) can catch exceptions from member initializers, but it must rethrow - you cannot "fix" a failed construction.
- `std::make_unique` and `std::make_shared` are single-allocation calls, so they don't have the "first alloc succeeds, second throws" problem within themselves.
- In member initializer lists, construction order follows **declaration order in the class**, not the order in the initializer list. Be careful of dependencies between members.
