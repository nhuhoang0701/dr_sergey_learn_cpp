## Topic Overview

This third cross-compilation file focuses on the **end-to-end workflow**: writing a toolchain file, cross-compiling a full project, running it under QEMU, and understanding why `CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_*` must be configured correctly. If you've read the companion files, think of this one as putting it all together in a single cohesive walkthrough.

### Cross-Compilation Workflow

The workflow is always five steps. Each step must succeed before the next one makes sense.

```cpp
1. Write toolchain file  ->  arm-linux-gnueabihf.cmake
2. Configure             ->  cmake -B build --toolchain arm-linux-gnueabihf.cmake
3. Build                 ->  cmake --build build
4. Test via QEMU         ->  ctest --test-dir build  (uses CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR)
5. Deploy                ->  scp build/app user@target-device:/opt/
```

### CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE Summary

The `MODE_*` settings are the most important detail to get right. The table below shows what each combination does. The conventional choice is `PROGRAM = NEVER`, everything else `= ONLY` - this is the right default for almost all cross-compilation scenarios.

| Mode | `NEVER` | `ONLY` | `BOTH` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **PROGRAM** | Search host only (tools) | Search target only | Search everywhere |
| **LIBRARY** | Search host only (danger!) | Search target only (correct) | Search everywhere |
| **INCLUDE** | Search host only (danger!) | Search target only (correct) | Search everywhere |
| **PACKAGE** | Search host only | Search target only (correct) | Search everywhere |

The convention is `PROGRAM = NEVER`, everything else `= ONLY`. This ensures build tools come from the host (where they will run) but libraries and headers come from the target sysroot (where they will be linked and used).

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Write a toolchain file that sets CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME, CMAKE_C_COMPILER, and sysroot for ARM Linux

**Answer:**

Here is a complete toolchain file for ARM32 hard-float, the kind you'd use for a Raspberry Pi running 32-bit Raspberry Pi OS. Notice that the CPU-specific flags go in `CMAKE_C_FLAGS_INIT` rather than as a `target_compile_options` call - they need to apply universally, before any targets are defined.

```cmake
# cmake/arm-linux-gnueabihf.cmake
# ARM 32-bit hard-float toolchain for Raspberry Pi / Debian armhf

# ======= Target platform =======
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)           # Triggers cross-compilation mode
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR armv7l)     # ARM 32-bit

# ======= Compilers =======
set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER   arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc)
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++)
set(CMAKE_ASM_COMPILER arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc)

# Optional: specify exact version if multiple installed
# set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER   /usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc-12)
# set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER /usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++-12)

# ======= Sysroot =======
# Contains target headers (/usr/include/) and libraries (/usr/lib/).
# Create:
#   sudo debootstrap --arch=armhf bullseye /opt/armhf-sysroot
#   OR: mount a Raspberry Pi SD card image
set(CMAKE_SYSROOT /opt/armhf-sysroot)

# ======= Search path control =======
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)  # Host tools (protoc, etc.)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)   # Target libraries
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)   # Target headers
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE ONLY)   # Target CMake packages

# ======= Emulator for testing =======
set(CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR "qemu-arm;-L;${CMAKE_SYSROOT}")

# ======= CPU-specific flags =======
set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS_INIT   "-march=armv7-a -mfpu=neon-vfpv4 -mfloat-abi=hard")
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_INIT "-march=armv7-a -mfpu=neon-vfpv4 -mfloat-abi=hard")
```

**Variables explained:**

- `CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` - any value other than the host OS triggers cross-compilation mode. This is the one variable that activates everything else.
- `CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR` - used by CMake's feature checks to understand what intrinsics and ISA extensions are available on the target.
- `CMAKE_SYSROOT` - passed to GCC as `--sysroot=` flag; all standard include/lib paths become relative to this root.
- `CMAKE_C_FLAGS_INIT` - flags set once during initial configuration. They survive reconfigures and apply to all compilation in this build tree.

### Q2: Cross-compile a CMake project for aarch64 on an x86_64 host and run it under QEMU

**Answer:**

Let's walk through the complete aarch64 workflow from scratch - tool installation all the way to deploying on real hardware. The key insight about QEMU performance is at the end.

```bash
# ======= Full aarch64 cross-compilation walkthrough =======

# Step 1: Install tools
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
    gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu g++-aarch64-linux-gnu \
    qemu-user qemu-user-binfmt

# Step 2: Create minimal sysroot (or use an existing ARM64 rootfs)
sudo debootstrap --arch=arm64 jammy /opt/arm64-sysroot

# Step 3: Write the toolchain file (aarch64-linux.cmake)
cat > cmake/aarch64-linux.cmake << 'EOF'
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR aarch64)
set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER   aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc)
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER aarch64-linux-gnu-g++)
set(CMAKE_SYSROOT /opt/arm64-sysroot)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE ONLY)
set(CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR "qemu-aarch64;-L;${CMAKE_SYSROOT}")
EOF

# Step 4: Configure
cmake -B build-arm64 \
    --toolchain cmake/aarch64-linux.cmake \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=20 \
    -DBUILD_TESTING=ON

# Step 5: Build
cmake --build build-arm64 --parallel $(nproc)

# Step 6: Verify it's an ARM64 binary
file build-arm64/myapp
# myapp: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, ARM aarch64, version 1 (SYSV)

# Step 7: Run manually under QEMU
qemu-aarch64 -L /opt/arm64-sysroot build-arm64/myapp
# Output: Hello from C++20 on aarch64

# Step 8: Run tests via ctest (uses QEMU automatically)
cd build-arm64 && ctest --output-on-failure --timeout 120
# ctest internally runs: qemu-aarch64 -L /opt/arm64-sysroot ./test_mylib
# All 15 tests passed

# Step 9: Deploy to real hardware
scp build-arm64/myapp user@arm-device:/opt/bin/
ssh user@arm-device /opt/bin/myapp
```

**QEMU performance note:** `qemu-user` translates ARM64 instructions to x86_64 at runtime with roughly 5-15x overhead compared to native execution. This is completely acceptable for correctness testing - your tests will pass or fail correctly. It is not acceptable for performance benchmarking, where you need actual target hardware or a proper ARM64 VM.

### Q3: Explain CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_* settings and why they are critical for cross builds

**Answer:**

This is the part most people get wrong the first time. The failure mode is silent at link time and only explodes at runtime on the target device with a cryptic "wrong ELF class" error. Understanding why the `MODE_*` settings exist prevents a lot of pain.

```cmake
# ======= What happens WITHOUT proper MODE settings =======
#
# Default (no toolchain file settings):
#   find_library(ZLIB z)
#     Searches: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so  <- HOST library
#     Found: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so
#     Links x86_64 libz into ARM binary -> CRASH at runtime
#     Error: "wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64" (expected ELFCLASS32 for armhf)
#
# ======= What happens WITH proper MODE settings =======
#
# set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)
# set(CMAKE_SYSROOT /opt/armhf-sysroot)
#
#   find_library(ZLIB z)
#     Searches: /opt/armhf-sysroot/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libz.so  <- TARGET
#     Found: correct ARM library
#     Links correctly -> works on ARM device

# ======= Why PROGRAM must be NEVER =======
#
# Build tools (protoc, moc, flex, bison) run on the HOST during build.
# If MODE_PROGRAM = ONLY:
#   find_program(PROTOC protoc)
#     Searches: /opt/armhf-sysroot/usr/bin/protoc  <- ARM binary
#     Can't execute ARM binary on x86_64 host -> build fails
#
# With MODE_PROGRAM = NEVER:
#   find_program(PROTOC protoc)
#     Searches: /usr/bin/protoc  <- HOST binary
#     Executes on host -> generates .pb.cc files -> cross-compiled into ARM

# ======= Debugging with --debug-find =======
```

You can use `--debug-find` to see exactly where CMake is looking:

```bash
# See exactly where CMake searches for each library/package:
cmake -B build --toolchain arm.cmake --debug-find 2>&1 | grep "find_library"

# Example output with MODE_LIBRARY ONLY:
# find_library(ZLIB_LIBRARY) searching:
#   /opt/armhf-sysroot/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf    <- sysroot
#   /opt/armhf-sysroot/usr/local/lib                    <- sysroot
# find_library(ZLIB_LIBRARY) result: /opt/armhf-sysroot/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libz.so

# Without ONLY mode, you'd also see:
#   /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu    <- HOST (wrong!)
#   /usr/local/lib                <- HOST (wrong!)
```

For more advanced use cases, you can extend the search path or override the mode per-call:

```cmake
# ======= Special case: CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH for extra libs =======

# If you installed custom libraries outside the sysroot:
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH
    /opt/armhf-sysroot         # Standard target libs
    /opt/custom-arm-libs       # Extra cross-compiled libraries
)

# Now find_library also searches:
#   /opt/custom-arm-libs/lib/
#   /opt/custom-arm-libs/usr/lib/

# ======= Per-call override =======
# Override the mode for a single find_* call:
find_library(HOST_TOOL tool
    NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH     # Ignore sysroot, search host
)

find_library(TARGET_LIB foo
    ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH   # Force sysroot search only
)
```

**Summary of the three settings for cross-compilation:**

| Setting | Value | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM` | `NEVER` | Build tools (protoc, moc) must run on the host |
| `CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY` | `ONLY` | Target libraries must match the target architecture |
| `CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE` | `ONLY` | Target headers may differ from host headers |

Without these settings, every `find_library` and `find_package` call risks pulling in host libraries. The resulting binary will link silently but crash at runtime on the target device with errors that give you very little hint about what went wrong.

---

## Notes

- **`CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE ONLY`** is also recommended - it restricts `find_package` config-file searches to the sysroot, preventing CMake from finding a host version of a package that happens to have the same name as a target package.
- **CMake presets** can encode toolchain files: `"toolchainFile": "cmake/aarch64-linux.cmake"` in `CMakePresets.json` makes the whole setup a one-command operation for any team member.
- **Docker-based cross-compilation** often uses multiarch packages instead of a sysroot: `dpkg --add-architecture arm64 && apt-get install libboost-all-dev:arm64` - this can be simpler to maintain than a full sysroot.
- **`NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`** on individual `find_*` calls overrides the global mode for that call only - useful for special-casing a particular tool or library that needs different search behavior.
