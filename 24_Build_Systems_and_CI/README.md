## Notes

- CMake is the dominant C++ build system - learn `target_link_libraries`, FetchContent, and presets.
- CMake presets (`CMakePresets.json`) standardize build configurations across developers so everyone uses the same flags without having to remember them.
- Vcpkg and Conan are the two main C++ package managers - vcpkg integrates especially tightly with CMake via its toolchain file.
- CI pipelines should build with multiple compilers (GCC, Clang, MSVC) to catch portability issues early, before they become surprises.
- Enable sanitizers (ASan, UBSan, TSan) in CI - they catch bugs at runtime that unit tests alone will never see.
- Unity builds (jumbo builds) combine translation units to reduce build times by cutting down on repeated header parsing.
- ccache caches compilation results so unchanged files aren't recompiled - essential for fast iterative development on large projects.
- Use `EXPORT` and `install()` in CMake to create reusable packages that downstream consumers can pick up with a simple `find_package`.
- Reproducible builds ensure binary output is identical given the same source - this aids security auditing and debugging.
- Keep build types separate: Debug (assertions + symbols), Release (optimizations), RelWithDebInfo (both) - mixing them up leads to confusing behavior.
