# Use Bazel or Buck2 as CMake alternatives for large monorepos

## Topic Overview

This file focuses on **monorepo-specific advantages** of Bazel and Buck2 versus CMake, covering reproducibility by design, the hermetic build model, and real-world performance comparisons for large-scale projects.

### Monorepo Build Challenges

```cpp

Large monorepo (1000+ targets):
├── services/auth/       (C++ microservice)
├── services/billing/    (C++ microservice)
├── libs/networking/     (shared C++ library)
├── libs/logging/        (shared C++ library)
├── tools/codegen/       (C++ code generator)
└── frontend/dashboard/  (TypeScript — Bazel handles polyglot!)

Problems CMake struggles with:

  1. Which targets changed? → CMake re-configures everything
  2. Can I cache across machines? → No native remote cache
  3. Is my build correct? → Implicit deps can hide bugs
  4. Can I parallelize across machines? → No remote execution

```

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Write a BUILD file that defines a cc_library and a cc_binary and builds them with bazel build

**Answer:**

```python

# libs/networking/BUILD
cc_library(
    name = "http_client",
    srcs = [
        "http_client.cpp",
        "connection_pool.cpp",
    ],
    hdrs = [
        "http_client.h",
        "connection_pool.h",
    ],
    deps = [
        "//libs/logging:logger",       # Internal dependency
        "@curl//:curl",                 # External C library
        "@abseil-cpp//absl/status",     # Abseil status
        "@abseil-cpp//absl/strings",
    ],
    copts = ["-std=c++20"],
    visibility = ["//services:__subpackages__"],  # Only services can use this
)

```

```python

# services/auth/BUILD
cc_binary(
    name = "auth_service",
    srcs = ["main.cpp", "auth_handler.cpp"],
    hdrs = ["auth_handler.h"],
    deps = [
        "//libs/networking:http_client",
        "//libs/logging:logger",
        "@grpc//:grpc++",
        "@protobuf//:protobuf",
    ],
    copts = ["-std=c++20", "-Wall", "-Wextra"],
    linkopts = ["-lpthread"],
)

cc_test(
    name = "auth_handler_test",
    srcs = ["auth_handler_test.cpp"],
    deps = [
        ":auth_service_lib",   # Extract testable lib from binary
        "@googletest//:gtest_main",
    ],
    size = "small",
)

```

```bash

# Build one target:
bazel build //services/auth:auth_service

# Build everything:
bazel build //...

# Build only changed targets since last commit:
bazel build //... --test_tag_filters=-large

# Query what depends on a library:
bazel query 'rdeps(//..., //libs/networking:http_client)'
# Output:
# //services/auth:auth_service
# //services/billing:billing_service
# → Shows impact of changing http_client

```

### Q2: Explain Bazel's hermetic build model and why it achieves reproducibility by construction

**Answer:**

```cpp

═══════════ Bazel's Hermetic Build Model ═══════════

Three pillars of hermeticity:

1. EXPLICIT DEPENDENCIES (no implicit includes)

   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ cc_library(                              │
   │   name = "parser",                       │
   │   srcs = ["parser.cpp"],                 │
   │   hdrs = ["parser.h"],                   │
   │   deps = ["//utils:string_helpers"],     │
   │ )                                        │
   │                                          │
   │ parser.cpp can ONLY #include:            │
   │   - parser.h (own hdrs)                  │
   │   - utils/string_helpers.h (from deps)   │
   │   - standard library headers             │
   │   - NOTHING ELSE (sandbox enforced!)     │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────┘

2. SANDBOXED EXECUTION

   Each build action runs in an isolated sandbox:

   - Only declared inputs are visible
   - Undeclared file system access fails
   - Environment variables are cleared
   - /tmp is per-action

   → Build result depends ONLY on declared inputs

3. CONTENT-ADDRESSED CACHING

   action_hash = hash(
     command_line,
     input_file_hashes,
     environment_variables,
     toolchain_hash
   )
   → Same inputs ALWAYS produce same outputs
   → Cache is correct by construction (no stale entries)

═══════════ Why CMake can't guarantee this ═══════════

CMake:

  - Uses file timestamps (not content hashes)
  - Header scanning is approximate (may miss deps)
  - No sandbox → can accidentally use host headers
  - No content-based cache → stale builds possible
  
  Example bug (can't happen in Bazel):

    1. Developer adds #include "utils/helper.h" to parser.cpp
    2. Forgets to add utils to CMake target_link_libraries
    3. Build works because helper.h is in the include path
    4. CI fails (or worse: links wrong version)
    5. Debugging takes hours

```

### Q3: Compare Bazel and CMake for a 1000-target monorepo: incremental build time, remote caching

**Answer:**

```cpp

═══════════ Performance Comparison (Real-World Data) ═══════════

Project: 1000 C++ targets, 500K lines of code, 200 test targets

                          │  CMake + Ninja      │  Bazel + Remote     │
                          │  (local, sccache)   │  (remote exec+cache)│
─────────────────────────┼─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┤
Full clean build          │  25 min (16 cores)  │  4 min (200 remote) │
1 header in lib changed   │  90 sec (recompile  │  5 sec (only        │
  (20 dependents)         │   all dependents)   │   affected actions) │
1 .cpp file changed       │  15 sec             │  3 sec              │
No-change rebuild         │  3 sec (Ninja)      │  0.5 sec (cached)   │
New developer first build │  25 min             │  4 min (cache warm) │
CI (warm cache)           │  5 min (sccache)    │  30 sec (remcache)  │
─────────────────────────┼─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┤
  
Space efficiency:
  CMake: each developer has full build tree (~10 GB)
  Bazel: shared remote cache, local only needs active targets

Correctness:
  CMake: missing deps may silently "work" until CI fails
  Bazel: sandbox catches ALL missing deps immediately

Scale ceiling:
  CMake: practical limit ~5000 targets (configure slows down)
  Bazel: tested at Google scale (millions of targets)

```

```bash

# ═══════════ Bazel remote caching performance ═══════════

# Developer A pushes a change, CI builds it:
bazel build //...
# INFO: 1000 processes: 950 remote cache hit, 50 internal

# Developer B pulls the same commit:
bazel build //...
# INFO: 1000 processes: 1000 remote cache hit
# Build time: 2 seconds (all from cache!)

# ═══════════ CMake equivalent requires more setup ═══════════
# cmake + sccache can cache compilation, but:
# - Linking is not cached
# - Test results are not cached  
# - Configuration step is not cached
# - Code generation steps are not cached
# Bazel caches ALL of these at the action level

```

**Migration cost:** Converting a CMake project to Bazel requires writing BUILD files for every target. For a 1000-target project, this is ~2-4 weeks of effort. The ROI depends on team size and CI frequency.

---

## Notes

- **Buck2** (Meta) uses a similar model but has better support for multi-language builds (C++ + Rust + Python)
- **Bazel's visibility system** controls which targets can depend on which — prevents "everybody depends on everything"
- **`bazel query`** and **`bazel cquery`** enable powerful dependency analysis: find affected targets, detect cycles, audit deps
- **Hybrid approach:** Use `rules_foreign_cc` to wrap existing CMake projects inside Bazel BUILD files during migration
- **Turborepo / Nx** are similar content-addressed build systems for JavaScript/TypeScript monorepos
