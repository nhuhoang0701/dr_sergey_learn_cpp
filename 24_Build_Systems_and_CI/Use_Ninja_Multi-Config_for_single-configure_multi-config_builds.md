## Topic Overview

The **Ninja Multi-Config** generator lets you configure CMake **once** and build **multiple configurations** (Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo) from the same build directory - no reconfigure needed. This saves time in development and CI pipelines.

The reason this is a worthwhile change from a single-config setup is practical: every time you reconfigure, CMake re-runs all of its checks and re-generates all its build files. That might be 5-30 seconds on a large project. With Ninja Multi-Config, you pay that cost once and then switch freely between Debug and Release just by changing `--config` on the build command. The build outputs go into separate subdirectories (`build/Debug/`, `build/Release/`), so neither configuration stomps on the other.

### Single-Config vs Multi-Config Generators

The most important difference in daily use is how the build type is specified. With single-config generators, it is a configure-time cache variable. With multi-config generators, it is a build-time flag:

| Feature | Single-Config (`Ninja`, `Makefiles`) | Multi-Config (`Ninja Multi-Config`, `Visual Studio`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE | Set at configure time | Set at **build** time via `--config` |
| Configurations | One per build dir | Multiple in same build dir |
| Switching configs | Must reconfigure | Just rebuild with `--config X` |
| Build dir structure | `build/` | `build/Debug/`, `build/Release/` |
| Configure count | Once per config | Once total |

### Workflow Comparison

Seeing the two workflows side by side makes the difference concrete:

```cpp
Single-Config (Ninja):
  cmake -B build-debug -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
  cmake -B build-release -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  -> Two configures, two build dirs

Multi-Config (Ninja Multi-Config):
  cmake -B build -G "Ninja Multi-Config"
  cmake --build build --config Debug
  cmake --build build --config Release
  -> One configure, one build dir, multiple configs
```

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Configure with -G 'Ninja Multi-Config' and build both Debug and Release without reconfiguring

**Answer:**

The configure step is where you declare which configurations will be available. After that, you just pick which one you want each time you build:

```bash
# Step 1: Configure once
cmake -B build -G "Ninja Multi-Config" \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=20 \
    -DCMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES="Debug;Release;RelWithDebInfo" \
    -DCMAKE_DEFAULT_BUILD_TYPE=Release
# Output:
# -- The CXX compiler identification is GNU 13.2.0
# -- Configuring done (0.3s)
# -- Generating done (0.1s)
# -- Build files: build/build-Debug.ninja, build/build-Release.ninja

# Step 2: Build Debug
cmake --build build --config Debug
# Compiles with -g -O0 flags
# Output: build/Debug/myapp

# Step 3: Build Release (NO reconfigure!)
cmake --build build --config Release
# Compiles with -O2 -DNDEBUG flags
# Output: build/Release/myapp

# Step 4: Build RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build build --config RelWithDebInfo
# Output: build/RelWithDebInfo/myapp

# Test each config
ctest --test-dir build --build-config Debug
ctest --test-dir build --build-config Release

# Install a specific config
cmake --install build --config Release --prefix /usr/local
```

The resulting directory structure keeps each configuration's artifacts completely separate, which is what lets you run both the debug and release binaries independently:

```cpp
Build directory structure:
build/
├── build.ninja              <- Main ninja file
├── build-Debug.ninja        <- Debug-specific rules
├── build-Release.ninja      <- Release-specific rules
├── Debug/
│   ├── myapp                <- Debug binary
│   └── libmylib.a
├── Release/
│   ├── myapp                <- Release binary
│   └── libmylib.a
└── CMakeFiles/              <- Shared CMake metadata
```

### Q2: Explain how multi-config generators differ from single-config generators in CMake

**Answer:**

The most common mistake when switching to a multi-config generator is using `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` in your `CMakeLists.txt` logic. That variable is empty for multi-config generators, so any `if(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE STREQUAL "Debug")` block simply never fires. The fix is to always use generator expressions, which work correctly with both generator types and select the right value at build time:

```cmake
# Single-Config Generator (Ninja, Unix Makefiles)
# CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is a CACHE variable set at configure time
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
# Build type is FIXED — changing it requires reconfigure:
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug  # Full reconfigure!

# In CMakeLists.txt, CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is available:
message(STATUS "Build type: ${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}")  # "Release"

# Generator expressions work but have only one active config:
target_compile_definitions(app PRIVATE
    $<$<CONFIG:Debug>:DEBUG_MODE>      # Only one triggers
    $<$<CONFIG:Release>:RELEASE_MODE>
)

# Multi-Config Generator (Ninja Multi-Config, VS, Xcode)
# CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is IGNORED — do NOT set it
cmake -B build -G "Ninja Multi-Config"
# -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release has NO effect here

# Use CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES instead:
cmake -B build -G "Ninja Multi-Config" \
    -DCMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES="Debug;Release;RelWithDebInfo;MinSizeRel"

# Config selected at BUILD time:
cmake --build build --config Debug
cmake --build build --config Release

# In CMakeLists.txt, CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is EMPTY for multi-config
# Use generator expressions for config-dependent logic:
target_compile_definitions(app PRIVATE
    $<$<CONFIG:Debug>:DEBUG_MODE>
    $<$<CONFIG:Release>:RELEASE_MODE>
)
# Both definitions are generated — the active one is selected at build time

# Writing CMakeLists.txt that works with both generators

# GOOD: generator expressions work for both single- and multi-config
target_compile_options(app PRIVATE
    $<$<CONFIG:Debug>:-g -O0 -fsanitize=address>
    $<$<CONFIG:Release>:-O2 -DNDEBUG>
)

# BAD: only works with single-config generators (ignored by multi-config)
if(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE STREQUAL "Debug")
    target_compile_options(app PRIVATE -g -O0)  # Ignored by multi-config!
endif()
```

The reason this trips people up is that the `if(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE ...)` pattern is extremely common in older CMake code and tutorials, and it works fine on single-config generators. But the moment you or a colleague switches to Ninja Multi-Config (or Visual Studio, or Xcode), that logic silently stops doing anything.

### Q3: Use --config Release in cmake --build to select the configuration at build time

**Answer:**

Here is a more complete look at the build-time config selection, including parallel builds and a CI pipeline example. The parallel build at the end is a nice practical trick: since each configuration writes into its own subdirectory, there is no conflict in building both simultaneously:

```bash
# Configure once
cmake -B build -G "Ninja Multi-Config" \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=20 \
    -DCMAKE_DEFAULT_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

# Build with --config
# Default config (Debug, since CMAKE_DEFAULT_BUILD_TYPE=Debug):
cmake --build build
# -> Builds Debug

# Explicit config — no reconfigure needed:
cmake --build build --config Release
# -> Builds Release, output in build/Release/

cmake --build build --config Debug
# -> Builds Debug, output in build/Debug/

# Parallel builds of different configs
# Since each config has separate output dirs, you can even build in parallel:
cmake --build build --config Debug   &
cmake --build build --config Release &
wait
# Both build simultaneously

# CI pipeline example
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
# jobs:
#   build:
#     steps:
#       - run: cmake -B build -G "Ninja Multi-Config"
#       - run: cmake --build build --config Debug
#       - run: ctest --test-dir build --build-config Debug
#       - run: cmake --build build --config Release
#       - run: ctest --test-dir build --build-config Release
#       # One configure, two build+test cycles — faster than two full pipelines

# With CMakePresets.json
# {
#   "configurePresets": [{
#     "name": "multi",
#     "generator": "Ninja Multi-Config",
#     "binaryDir": "${sourceDir}/build",
#     "cacheVariables": {
#       "CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES": "Debug;Release"
#     }
#   }],
#   "buildPresets": [
#     { "name": "debug",   "configurePreset": "multi", "configuration": "Debug" },
#     { "name": "release", "configurePreset": "multi", "configuration": "Release" }
#   ]
# }
#
# cmake --preset multi
# cmake --build --preset debug
# cmake --build --preset release
```

## Notes

- **`CMAKE_DEFAULT_BUILD_TYPE`** sets which config `cmake --build build` uses when `--config` is omitted
- **`CMAKE_CROSS_CONFIGS`** (advanced): allows building targets from one config using another's settings (e.g., Debug executable with Release libraries)
- **IDE support:** VS Code CMake Tools, CLion, and Visual Studio all understand multi-config generators
- **Ninja Multi-Config requires CMake 3.17+** and Ninja 1.10+
