## Topic Overview

### Why Standard Profilers Aren't Enough

Tools like `perf` and `gprof` tell you **where** time is being spent - which functions are hot. That is useful, but it does not tell you **why** those functions are slow. Are you waiting on memory? Is the CPU stalling because it can't fetch instructions fast enough? Are branch mispredictions draining your pipeline? Micro-architectural profilers answer these questions by exposing the hardware performance counters that the CPU collects internally.

### Intel VTune Profiler

VTune organizes its analysis into several types, each targeting a different kind of bottleneck. Here is what each one is good for:

| Analysis Type | What It Shows |
| --- | --- |
| **Hotspots** | Functions consuming the most CPU time |
| **Microarchitecture Exploration** | Top-down pipeline analysis (retiring, bad speculation, FE/BE bound) |
| **Memory Access** | Cache miss rates, DRAM bandwidth, NUMA effects |
| **Threading** | Lock contention, thread imbalance, synchronization overhead |
| **HPC Performance** | GFLOPS, vectorization efficiency, roofline model |

Most of the time you start with Microarchitecture Exploration, read the top-down breakdown, and then drill into the specific analysis type that matches your bottleneck category.

**Command-line usage:**

```bash
# Collect microarchitecture data
vtune -collect uarch-exploration -result-dir vtune_results ./my_app

# Generate a report
vtune -report summary -result-dir vtune_results

# Source-level annotation
vtune -report hotspots -result-dir vtune_results -source-object my_app

# Interactive GUI
vtune-gui vtune_results
```

**Typical VTune output (Microarchitecture Exploration):**

```text
Pipeline Slots Analysis:
  Retiring:          32.5%   <- useful work
  Bad Speculation:    8.2%   <- branch mispredictions
  Front-End Bound:    5.1%   <- instruction delivery stalls
  Back-End Bound:    54.2%   <- execution stalls (memory or compute)
    Memory Bound:    41.8%   <- cache misses dominate
    Core Bound:      12.4%   <- port contention
Top Memory Bound Hotspots:
  L1 Bound:    8.3%
  L2 Bound:   12.1%
  L3 Bound:   15.7%
  DRAM Bound:  5.7%
```

Reading this output is straightforward once you know the vocabulary. "Retiring" is the percentage of pipeline slots doing real work. Everything else is waste. If Back-End Bound is the dominant category and Memory Bound is the dominant sub-category, your next step is a Memory Access analysis to find which data structure is causing cache misses.

### AMD uProf

AMD's profiler covers Zen-based processors with similar capabilities to VTune, but tuned for AMD hardware counters. The command-line interface is slightly different:

```bash
# Collect micro-architecture data
AMDuProfCLI collect --config tbp -o uprof_results ./my_app

# IBS (Instruction Based Sampling) for precise attribution
AMDuProfCLI collect --config ibs -o uprof_results ./my_app

# Generate report
AMDuProfCLI report -i uprof_results

# Launch GUI
AMDuProfUI
```

**AMD uProf analysis types:**

| Analysis | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Time-based profiling (TBP)** | CPU time per function |
| **Instruction-Based Sampling (IBS)** | Precise µop-level analysis |
| **L3 Cache Access** | Cache miss patterns |
| **Memory Bandwidth** | Channel utilization |

IBS is worth understanding on its own - it is described in detail in the Self-Assessment questions below.

### Roofline Model Analysis

Both tools support **roofline model** visualization. The idea is simple: your code has two possible limiting factors - how fast the CPU can compute, and how fast memory can deliver data. The roofline plots these as a diagram and shows you which limit you are hitting.

```cpp
Performance (GFLOPS/s)
     ^
     |        * Peak Compute  _______________
     |       /               /
     |      /               /
     |     /  * Your code  /
     |    /               /
     |   /  Memory bound / Compute bound
     |  /               /
     +----------------------------------------------------->
        Arithmetic Intensity (FLOPS/byte)
```

If your code falls below the roofline, the gap shows your optimization potential. A point on the sloped portion of the curve is memory-bound; a point on the flat ceiling is compute-bound.

### Integrating with C++ Code

You can annotate your code with VTune's instrumentation API to focus the profiler on specific regions rather than the entire application. This is especially useful when your hot region is inside a larger program with a slow startup phase.

```cpp
#include <ittnotify.h>  // VTune instrumentation API

void process_batch(const Data& data) {
    // Mark a region for VTune analysis
    __itt_domain* domain = __itt_domain_create("MyApp");
    __itt_string_handle* task = __itt_string_handle_create("process_batch");

    __itt_task_begin(domain, __itt_null, __itt_null, task);

    // ... hot code to analyze ...

    __itt_task_end(domain);
}
```

```cmake
# Link VTune instrumentation API
find_package(ittnotify REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(myapp PRIVATE ittnotify)
```

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: When would you use VTune's "Memory Access" analysis

You reach for the Memory Access analysis when `perf stat` or VTune's microarchitecture exploration shows a high **Back-End Bound -> Memory Bound** percentage. That top-down result tells you cache misses are the bottleneck, but not where they come from. The Memory Access analysis drills down to:

- Which cache level is the bottleneck (L1, L2, L3, DRAM).
- Which data structures are causing cache misses.
- NUMA remote access patterns in multi-socket systems.

### Q2: What is IBS and why is it more accurate than sampling

**Instruction-Based Sampling (IBS)** is an AMD hardware feature that works differently from ordinary PMU-based sampling. Instead of firing an interrupt every N cycles and recording the instruction pointer at that moment (which attributes events to nearby but not necessarily guilty instructions), IBS:

- Tags a specific µop as it enters the pipeline.
- Tracks that µop through the entire pipeline (fetch, decode, dispatch, execute, retire).
- Records precise events: cache levels hit/miss, branch taken/not-taken, latency.

Unlike PMU sampling, which can attribute events to nearby instructions because the interrupt fires slightly after the event (a phenomenon called "skid"), IBS attributes events to the **exact instruction** that caused them. This makes it much easier to identify, for example, the exact load instruction that is generating L3 misses.

### Q3: How do you use the roofline model to guide optimization

1. **Measure** your code's arithmetic intensity (FLOPS per byte transferred from memory).
2. **Plot** it on the roofline: if you're below the sloped line, you're **memory bound**; if below the flat ceiling, you're **compute bound**.
3. **Optimize accordingly:**
   - Memory bound -> improve data locality, use prefetching, reduce data size.
   - Compute bound -> use SIMD, reduce instruction count, improve ILP.

## Notes

- VTune is free for all users (part of Intel oneAPI toolkit).
- AMD uProf is free and works on all AMD Zen processors.
- Both tools require root/admin access for hardware counter access.
- Use `likwid` as an open-source alternative that works on both Intel and AMD.
- Always profile on the **target hardware** - results differ significantly between CPU generations.
