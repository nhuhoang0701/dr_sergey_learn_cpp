## Topic Overview

Every loop iteration carries a small amount of overhead: increment the counter, compare against the limit, and branch back to the top. For a tight loop doing a tiny amount of work per iteration, that overhead can represent a significant fraction of the total time. Loop unrolling removes it by copying the loop body multiple times per iteration, so you branch back less often.

There is a second benefit that matters just as much: unrolling creates opportunities for the CPU's out-of-order engine to find independent work. Four consecutive additions in a row can all start in the same cycle if they operate on different data; a single addition repeated in a loop cannot, because each iteration depends on the previous result.

Here is the basic idea visually:

```cpp
Original loop:                Unrolled x4:
  for (i=0; i<N; ++i)          for (i=0; i<N; i+=4) {
    a[i] = b[i] + c[i];          a[i]   = b[i]   + c[i];
                                  a[i+1] = b[i+1] + c[i+1];
                                  a[i+2] = b[i+2] + c[i+2];
                                  a[i+3] = b[i+3] + c[i+3];
  1 branch per iteration        }
                                1 branch per 4 iterations
```

| Benefit | Drawback |
| --- | --- |
| Less loop overhead | Larger code size (icache pressure) |
| Better ILP (instruction-level parallelism) | Register pressure may increase |
| Enables SIMD vectorization | Cleanup code for remainder (N%unroll) |
| Helps prefetcher | Diminishing returns past 4-8x |

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Manual unrolling with `#pragma`

The `#pragma GCC unroll N` directive tells the compiler to unroll the following loop by a factor of N. The compiler still handles the cleanup for cases where N does not divide evenly into the loop count. The second function below shows full unrolling for a known small loop - the compiler emits 16 straight-line instructions with no branch at all.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <chrono>

void add_no_pragma(float* __restrict a, const float* __restrict b,
                   const float* __restrict c, int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        a[i] = b[i] + c[i];
    }
}

void add_unroll4(float* __restrict a, const float* __restrict b,
                 const float* __restrict c, int n) {
    #pragma GCC unroll 4
    // Clang: #pragma unroll(4)
    // MSVC:  #pragma loop(unroll, 4)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        a[i] = b[i] + c[i];
    }
    // Compiler generates equivalent of:
    //   for (i=0; i<n; i+=4) {
    //     a[i]=b[i]+c[i]; a[i+1]=b[i+1]+c[i+1];
    //     a[i+2]=b[i+2]+c[i+2]; a[i+3]=b[i+3]+c[i+3];
    //   }
    //   // plus cleanup for n%4 remainder
}

void add_unroll_full(float* __restrict a, const float* __restrict b,
                     const float* __restrict c, int n) {
    // For known-small loops:
    #pragma GCC unroll 16
    for (int i = 0; i < 16; ++i) {
        a[i] = b[i] + c[i];
    }
    // Fully unrolled: NO loop at all, just 16 straight-line instructions
}

int main() {
    constexpr int N = 10'000'000;
    std::vector<float> a(N), b(N, 1.0f), c(N, 2.0f);

    auto bench = [&](auto fn, const char* label) {
        auto t0 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
        for (int r = 0; r < 100; ++r) fn(a.data(), b.data(), c.data(), N);
        auto t1 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
        auto us = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(t1 - t0);
        std::cout << label << ": " << us.count() / 100 << " us\n";
    };

    bench(add_no_pragma, "No pragma  ");
    bench(add_unroll4,   "Unroll x4  ");
    // Compile: g++ -O2 -march=native -o test test.cpp
}
```

In practice, for a simple elementwise loop like this, the compiler will often vectorize it with SIMD and the unrolling difference becomes secondary. But for reduction loops with dependencies, the pragma really makes a difference - see Q2.

### Q2: When unrolling helps vs hurts

The payoff from unrolling comes from breaking dependency chains. The serial sum example is ideal: a single accumulator forces every addition to wait for the previous one, limiting throughput to one add every 3-4 cycles. Four independent accumulators let the CPU overlap four addition chains, delivering up to 4 adds per 3-4 cycles.

The danger is going too far. Unrolling 64x means the loop body no longer fits in the L1 instruction cache, and you start paying icache miss penalties on top of the work you are trying to speed up:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <chrono>

// HELPS: pipeline fill, ILP, reduced branch overhead
void sum_unrolled(const float* data, int n, float& result) {
    float s0 = 0, s1 = 0, s2 = 0, s3 = 0; // 4 independent accumulators
    int i = 0;
    for (; i + 3 < n; i += 4) {
        s0 += data[i];     // These 4 adds are INDEPENDENT
        s1 += data[i+1];   // CPU can execute them in parallel
        s2 += data[i+2];   // (out-of-order engine, multiple add units)
        s3 += data[i+3];
    }
    for (; i < n; ++i) s0 += data[i]; // cleanup
    result = s0 + s1 + s2 + s3;
}

// Without unrolling: serial dependency chain
void sum_serial(const float* data, int n, float& result) {
    float s = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        s += data[i];  // Each add depends on previous result!
        // Latency: ~3-4 cycles per add (FP pipeline)
        // Throughput limited to 1 add every 3-4 cycles
    }
    result = s;
}

// HURTS: over-unrolling causes icache pressure
void sum_overunrolled(const float* data, int n, float& result) {
    #pragma GCC unroll 64  // Way too much!
    float s = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) s += data[i];
    result = s;
    // 64x unrolled: loop body doesn't fit in L1 icache (32KB)
    // Result: icache misses SLOW DOWN the code!
}

int main() {
    constexpr int N = 100'000'000;
    std::vector<float> data(N, 1.0f);
    float r;

    auto bench = [&](auto fn, const char* label) {
        auto t0 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
        fn(data.data(), N, r);
        auto t1 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
        auto ms = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::milliseconds>(t1 - t0);
        std::cout << label << ": " << ms.count() << " ms\n";
    };

    bench(sum_serial,       "Serial (no unroll) ");
    bench(sum_unrolled,     "Unrolled x4        ");
    bench(sum_overunrolled, "Over-unrolled x64  ");
    // Serial:  ~100ms (latency-bound: 1 add/3 cycles)
    // x4:      ~25ms  (4 independent chains: 4 adds/3 cycles)
    // x64:     ~30ms  (icache pressure counteracts the benefit)
}
```

The sweet spot is 4-8x for most loops. Beyond that, the icache pressure penalty starts eating back the gains.

### Q3: Verify unrolling with `-funroll-loops` and assembly inspection

The best way to confirm unrolling actually happened is to look at the assembly, either with `-S` or on Compiler Explorer (godbolt.org). The comments below show what to look for - one branch per iteration versus one branch per four iterations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Compile with different flags and compare assembly:
//
//   g++ -O2 -S test.cpp -o no_unroll.s
//   g++ -O2 -funroll-loops -S test.cpp -o unrolled.s
//
// Or use Compiler Explorer (godbolt.org):
//   Flags: -O2 vs -O2 -funroll-loops

void array_add(float* __restrict a, const float* __restrict b,
               const float* __restrict c, int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        a[i] = b[i] + c[i];
    }
}

// WITHOUT -funroll-loops (g++ -O2):
// .L3:
//   movss  xmm0, [rsi + rax*4]      ; load b[i]
//   addss  xmm0, [rdx + rax*4]      ; add c[i]
//   movss  [rdi + rax*4], xmm0       ; store a[i]
//   inc    rax                        ; i++
//   cmp    rax, rcx                   ; i < n?
//   jl     .L3                        ; branch (1 per iteration)
//
// WITH -funroll-loops (g++ -O2 -funroll-loops):
// .L3:
//   movss  xmm0, [rsi + rax*4]      ; iter 0
//   addss  xmm0, [rdx + rax*4]
//   movss  [rdi + rax*4], xmm0
//   movss  xmm0, [rsi + rax*4 + 4]  ; iter 1
//   addss  xmm0, [rdx + rax*4 + 4]
//   movss  [rdi + rax*4 + 4], xmm0
//   ...                               ; iter 2, 3
//   add    rax, 4
//   cmp    rax, rcx
//   jl     .L3                        ; 1 branch per 4 iterations
//
// With -O3 or -O2 -ftree-vectorize -march=native:
//   Uses SIMD: movups, addps (4 floats at once!)
//   Combined with unrolling: 16 floats per loop iteration

int main() {
    float a[16], b[16], c[16];
    for (int i = 0; i < 16; ++i) { b[i] = i; c[i] = i * 2; }
    array_add(a, b, c, 16);
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i)
        std::cout << a[i] << ' ';  // 0 3 6 9
    std::cout << '\n';
}
```

Notice that at `-O3` or with `-ftree-vectorize -march=native`, the compiler may go further and emit SIMD instructions, processing 4 or 8 floats per instruction. Unrolling and vectorization stack on top of each other.

## Notes

- `#pragma GCC unroll N` (GCC 8+) / `#pragma unroll(N)` (Clang) / `#pragma loop(unroll, N)` (MSVC).
- `-funroll-loops` enables automatic unrolling globally; `-O3` includes it for GCC.
- Sweet spot: unroll 4-8x for most loops. Beyond that, icache pressure dominates.
- Unrolling is most beneficial for loops with independent iterations (no loop-carried dependency). It helps less when the bottleneck is something else (memory bandwidth, branch misprediction).
- For FP reductions, use multiple accumulators to break dependency chains - that is the most important unrolling pattern to know.
