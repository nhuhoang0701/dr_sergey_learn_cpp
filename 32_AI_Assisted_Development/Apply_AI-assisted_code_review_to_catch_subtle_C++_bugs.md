# Apply AI-assisted code review to catch subtle C++ bugs

**Category:** AI-Assisted C++ Development

---

## Topic Overview

Code review is one of those tasks where humans and AI have genuinely complementary strengths - and understanding the split is what makes AI-assisted review so effective. AI review augments human reviewers by systematically checking for patterns that are easy to miss: **lifetime issues**, **exception safety gaps**, **integer promotion bugs**, **incorrect const usage**, and **thread-safety violations**. The AI reviewer is tireless and consistent - it will check every function for a missing lock, every pointer for an ownership question, every constructor for a partial-construction hazard. The human reviewer, freed from that exhausting checklist work, can focus on design, architecture, and business logic correctness - the things AI is genuinely weak at.

The table below captures where each approach pays off. Think of it as a division of labor, not a competition.

### AI vs Human Review Strengths

| Bug Category | Human | AI | Best Approach |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Undefined behavior | Sometimes misses | Good pattern matching | AI first, human verifies |
| Logic errors | Good | Medium | Human primary |
| Thread safety | Often misses | Good at data race patterns | AI + TSan |
| Design quality | Excellent | Weak | Human primary |
| Missing error handling | Sometimes misses | Systematic | AI primary |
| Performance issues | Context-dependent | Pattern-based | Both |
| API misuse | Context-dependent | Good if trained | AI primary |

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Structure AI code review prompts for C++ pull requests

**Answer:**

The trick with review prompts is specificity - a generic "review this code" gets a generic response. If you explicitly enumerate the categories of bugs you care about, the AI will walk through each one methodically. Here is a structured prompt template that works well for C++ pull requests:

```cpp
=== SYSTEMATIC C++ REVIEW PROMPT ===

"Review this C++ code change. For each finding, provide:

- Line number
- Severity: CRITICAL / WARNING / SUGGESTION
- Category: correctness / safety / performance / style
- Description of the issue
- Suggested fix with code

Check specifically for:

LIFETIME ISSUES:
- Dangling references/pointers (returning ref to local,
  ref to temporary, iterator invalidation)
- Use after move
- Pointers to stack variables escaping scope

UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR:
- Signed integer overflow
- Null pointer dereference on any code path
- Out-of-bounds access
- Uninitialized variable reads
- Strict aliasing violations (reinterpret_cast misuse)

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Raw new/delete without RAII wrapper
- File handles, sockets, mutexes not RAII-managed
- Exception safety: what leaks if line X throws?

CONCURRENCY:
- Shared mutable state without synchronization
- Lock ordering (potential deadlock)
- Condition variable spurious wakeup not handled
- atomic operations with wrong memory ordering

```

Now here is a realistic example of what AI review looks like in practice. Notice how the AI spots the raw-pointer ownership problems that are easy to miss when you are focused on whether the logic is right:

```cpp
// === Example: AI review catches subtle bugs ===

// Pull request code:
class ConnectionPool {
    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Connection>> idle_;
    std::mutex mtx_;
public:
    Connection* acquire() {
        std::lock_guard lock(mtx_);
        if (idle_.empty()) {
            return new Connection(config_);  // AI: raw new, leak risk
        }
        auto conn = std::move(idle_.back());
        idle_.pop_back();
        return conn.release();  // AI: caller must delete, error-prone
    }

    void release(Connection* conn) {
        std::lock_guard lock(mtx_);
        idle_.emplace_back(conn);
    }
};

// AI review output:
// CRITICAL [line 8]: Raw new without RAII. If caller forgets
//   to call release(), connection leaks.
//   Fix: Return std::unique_ptr<Connection> with custom deleter
//   that returns to pool.
//
// WARNING [line 13]: Connection* ownership unclear.
//   No documentation on who owns the pointer.
//   Fix: Use unique_ptr with pool-returning deleter.
//
// SUGGESTION: Consider returning a RAII guard:

class PooledConnection {
public:
    PooledConnection(std::unique_ptr<Connection> conn,
                     ConnectionPool& pool)
        : conn_(std::move(conn)), pool_(pool) {}

    ~PooledConnection() {
        if (conn_) pool_.release(std::move(conn_));
    }

    Connection& operator*() { return *conn_; }
    Connection* operator->() { return conn_.get(); }

private:
    std::unique_ptr<Connection> conn_;
    ConnectionPool& pool_;
};
```

The AI flagged two separate ownership problems in the same class - exactly the kind of systematic sweep that saves your code review from devolving into a manual line-by-line audit.

### Q2: Detect thread-safety issues with AI review

**Answer:**

Thread-safety bugs are one of the hardest categories for humans to catch reliably because you have to mentally trace every possible interleaving of threads every time you read the code. AI review shines here because it can look for the structural patterns - "this method reads shared state, is there a lock?" - without needing to simulate execution.

The example below is a class that looks reasonable at first glance but has two distinct data races hiding in plain sight:

```cpp
// === Code submitted for review ===
class MetricsCollector {
    struct Counter {
        std::string name;
        int64_t value = 0;
    };

    std::vector<Counter> counters_;  // Shared state
    std::mutex mtx_;

public:
    void increment(const std::string& name) {
        std::lock_guard lock(mtx_);
        for (auto& c : counters_) {
            if (c.name == name) {
                c.value++;
                return;
            }
        }
        counters_.push_back({name, 1});
    }

    // BUG: No lock! Data race with increment()
    int64_t get(const std::string& name) const {
        for (const auto& c : counters_) {
            if (c.name == name)
                return c.value;
        }
        return 0;
    }

    // BUG: Returns copy of internal state, but the copy
    // itself is not atomic - could see partial updates
    std::vector<Counter> snapshot() const {
        return counters_;  // No lock!
    }
};

// AI review catches:
// CRITICAL [line 23]: get() reads counters_ without lock.
//   Data race with increment() which modifies counters_.
//   Fix: Add std::lock_guard lock(mtx_);
//   Note: mtx_ must be declared mutable for const methods.
//
// CRITICAL [line 30]: snapshot() copies vector without lock.
//   Data race: another thread may be inserting while copying.
//   Fix: Lock, then copy.
//
// WARNING: Linear search O(n) per increment.
//   Consider std::unordered_map for O(1) lookup.
//
// SUGGESTION: Use std::shared_mutex for read-heavy workload:
//   - get()/snapshot(): shared_lock (multiple concurrent reads)
//   - increment(): unique_lock (exclusive write)

// FIXED VERSION:
class MetricsCollector {
    std::unordered_map<std::string, std::atomic<int64_t>> counters_;
    mutable std::shared_mutex mtx_;

public:
    void increment(const std::string& name) {
        std::shared_lock lock(mtx_);
        auto it = counters_.find(name);
        if (it != counters_.end()) {
            it->second.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);
            return;
        }
        lock.unlock();
        std::unique_lock wlock(mtx_);
        counters_[name].fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);
    }

    int64_t get(const std::string& name) const {
        std::shared_lock lock(mtx_);
        auto it = counters_.find(name);
        return it != counters_.end()
            ? it->second.load(std::memory_order_relaxed) : 0;
    }
};
```

The fixed version addresses both data races and also upgrades the lock strategy: reads use a shared lock so multiple threads can read concurrently, while writes take an exclusive lock.

### Q3: Pre-commit AI review hook

**Answer:**

One of the best uses of AI review is as a structured pre-commit checklist - you feed it the diff and ask it to verify each category before the code is even submitted for human review. Here is a checklist template that works well as a prompt:

```cpp
=== PRE-COMMIT REVIEW CHECKLIST (automated) ===

For each changed .cpp/.hpp file, verify:

1. OWNERSHIP CLARITY
   [ ] Every raw pointer has clear ownership documentation
   [ ] No raw new/delete (use make_unique/make_shared)
   [ ] All resources have RAII wrappers

2. CONST CORRECTNESS
   [ ] All methods that don't modify state are const
   [ ] Parameters passed by const reference where appropriate
   [ ] Return const reference for non-owning access

3. EXCEPTION SAFETY
   [ ] Constructors: no partial construction possible
   [ ] Destructors: noexcept (implicit or explicit)
   [ ] Swap operations: noexcept
   [ ] Move operations: noexcept

4. THREAD SAFETY
   [ ] All shared mutable state protected by mutex
   [ ] No lock held during callbacks or user code
   [ ] Condition variables use predicate form (while loop)
   [ ] No TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) patterns

5. MODERN C++ USAGE
   [ ] Using structured bindings where appropriate
   [ ] Using auto for complex iterator types
   [ ] Using string_view for non-owning string parameters
   [ ] Using [[nodiscard]] for functions returning values
```

Running this systematically before human review means the human reviewer spends their time on design decisions, not hunting for missing `const` qualifiers.

## Notes

- AI review is a **supplement**, not a replacement, for human review.
- The **diff-only** review ("review only the changes") is more effective than reviewing entire files - it keeps the AI focused.
- AI excels at **systematic checking** that humans find tedious (const correctness, nodiscard, error paths).
- Always validate AI findings - false positives are common, especially for "thread-safety" warnings where the AI may not see the full synchronization picture.
- Best workflow: AI review first -> author addresses findings -> human review for design and logic.
- Thread-safety bugs found by AI review should be **confirmed with TSan** before you are confident they are real.
- Consider integrating AI review as a CI check on pull requests.
