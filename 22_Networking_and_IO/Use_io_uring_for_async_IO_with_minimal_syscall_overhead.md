## Topic Overview

This topic focuses on batch submission and SQPOLL mode - complementing #640 (basic setup + CQ polling) and #551 (C++ RAII wrapper + SQ/CQ model).

The biggest win io_uring offers over traditional async I/O is that you can submit many operations in a single syscall, and in SQPOLL mode you can eliminate submit syscalls entirely. Here is how those two ideas look conceptually:

```cpp
Batch submission (multiple ops, one syscall):
  sqe1 = get_sqe()  -> prep_read(file1)
  sqe2 = get_sqe()  -> prep_read(file2)
  sqe3 = get_sqe()  -> prep_write(file3)
  io_uring_submit()  -> ONE syscall submits all 3!

SQPOLL mode (zero submit syscalls):
  Kernel thread continuously polls the SQ ring
  User writes SQE -> kernel picks it up automatically
  No io_uring_enter() needed for submission!
```

The table below compares the four operational modes. The tradeoff is always latency versus privilege requirements:

| Mode | Submit cost | Complete cost | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Normal | io_uring_enter per batch | io_uring_wait_cqe | General use |
| SQPOLL | Zero (kernel polls) | peek_cqe (no syscall) | Ultra-low latency |
| IOPOLL | io_uring_enter per batch | Busy-poll CQ | NVMe SSD |
| SQPOLL + IOPOLL | Zero | Busy-poll CQ | Highest throughput |

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Batch submit multiple read operations

The key insight here is that you fill in all three SQEs before calling `io_uring_submit` once. Compare this with three separate `pread` calls, each of which is a syscall. With io_uring you pay one syscall for the whole batch regardless of how many operations you submit.

```cpp
// Requires: liburing
// Compile: g++ -std=c++20 -luring batch_submit.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>
#include <liburing.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    struct io_uring ring;
    io_uring_queue_init(64, &ring, 0);

    // Open multiple files
    const char* files[] = {"/etc/hostname", "/etc/os-release", "/etc/shells"};
    constexpr int NFILES = 3;
    int fds[NFILES];
    char bufs[NFILES][256] = {};

    for (int i = 0; i < NFILES; ++i) {
        fds[i] = open(files[i], O_RDONLY);
        if (fds[i] < 0) { perror(files[i]); continue; }

        // Prepare SQE for each file (no syscall yet!)
        auto* sqe = io_uring_get_sqe(&ring);
        io_uring_prep_read(sqe, fds[i], bufs[i], 255, 0);
        sqe->user_data = i;  // tag to identify in completion
    }

    // Submit ALL requests in ONE syscall
    int submitted = io_uring_submit(&ring);
    std::cout << "Submitted " << submitted << " reads in 1 syscall\n";

    // Harvest completions
    for (int i = 0; i < submitted; ++i) {
        struct io_uring_cqe* cqe;
        io_uring_wait_cqe(&ring, &cqe);

        int idx = cqe->user_data;
        if (cqe->res >= 0) {
            bufs[idx][cqe->res] = '\0';
            std::cout << files[idx] << " (" << cqe->res << " bytes): "
                      << bufs[idx] << '\n';
        } else {
            std::cerr << files[idx] << ": error " << strerror(-cqe->res) << '\n';
        }
        io_uring_cqe_seen(&ring, cqe);
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < NFILES; ++i) close(fds[i]);
    io_uring_queue_exit(&ring);
}
```

The `user_data` field on each SQE is how you correlate a completion back to the original request. When the CQE arrives, `cqe->user_data` carries back exactly the value you put in `sqe->user_data` - in this case the file index. That is the fundamental tagging mechanism for all io_uring work.

### Q2: SQPOLL mode - zero syscall submission

SQPOLL is where io_uring gets genuinely exotic. A kernel thread wakes up and continuously polls the submission ring. You write an SQE into shared memory and the kernel thread picks it up without you ever making a syscall. The tradeoff is that this kernel thread consumes a CPU core, so SQPOLL is only worthwhile at very high I/O rates where the thread stays busy most of the time.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
#include <liburing.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    // SQPOLL: kernel thread continuously polls the submission ring
    struct io_uring ring;
    struct io_uring_params params{};
    params.flags = IORING_SETUP_SQPOLL;
    params.sq_thread_idle = 10000;  // kernel thread sleeps after 10s idle

    int ret = io_uring_queue_init_params(64, &ring, &params);
    if (ret < 0) {
        std::cerr << "SQPOLL requires CAP_SYS_NICE or root: "
                  << strerror(-ret) << '\n';
        // Fallback
        io_uring_queue_init(64, &ring, 0);
        std::cout << "Falling back to normal mode\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "SQPOLL mode active!\n";
        std::cout << "  SQ thread CPU: " << params.sq_thread_cpu << '\n';
    }

    int fd = open("/etc/hostname", O_RDONLY);
    char buf[256] = {};

    auto* sqe = io_uring_get_sqe(&ring);
    io_uring_prep_read(sqe, fd, buf, 255, 0);
    sqe->user_data = 1;

    // With SQPOLL: kernel thread picks up the SQE automatically
    // io_uring_submit() is optional (just wakes the thread if idle)
    io_uring_submit(&ring);  // wake SQ thread if sleeping

    // Poll CQ for completion (no syscall)
    struct io_uring_cqe* cqe;
    while (io_uring_peek_cqe(&ring, &cqe) != 0) {
        // busy-poll (in production: use io_uring_wait_cqe)
    }

    std::cout << "Read " << cqe->res << " bytes: " << buf;
    io_uring_cqe_seen(&ring, cqe);

    std::cout << "\nSQPOLL data path (zero syscalls):\n";
    std::cout << "  1. User writes SQE to shared ring memory\n";
    std::cout << "  2. Kernel SQ thread polls ring, submits I/O\n";
    std::cout << "  3. Kernel writes CQE to shared ring memory\n";
    std::cout << "  4. User reads CQE from shared memory (peek)\n";
    std::cout << "  Total syscalls: 0 (in steady-state)!\n";

    close(fd);
    io_uring_queue_exit(&ring);
}
```

Note that `io_uring_submit()` in SQPOLL mode just wakes the kernel thread if it has gone idle - it does not perform a real submission syscall in the usual sense. If your workload is bursty, the thread will sleep between bursts and then be woken on demand. At sustained high load it stays awake and polls continuously, which is when you get the zero-syscall steady state.

### Q3: io_uring vs epoll+read throughput

The numbers below are representative benchmarks for random 4 KB reads from an NVMe SSD. They illustrate the performance cliff between the two approaches.

| Metric | epoll + pread | io_uring (normal) | io_uring + SQPOLL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IOPS | ~120K | ~400K | ~500K |
| CPU/IOPS | High (2 syscalls/op) | Medium (batched) | Low (zero syscall) |
| p99 latency | ~15µs | ~5µs | ~3µs |
| Batch efficiency | None | Excellent | Excellent |

Here is why io_uring wins, broken down by mechanism:

1. **Batch submission**: N operations per syscall vs 1 syscall per operation (epoll + read).
2. **No context switches for completion**: CQE is in shared memory.
3. **True async file I/O**: epoll doesn't work with regular files (falls back to thread pool); io_uring handles files natively.
4. **Registered buffers**: `io_uring_register_buffers()` pins memory pages, avoiding per-I/O page-table walks.
5. **Linked operations**: chain dependent ops (read -> process -> write) without returning to user space.

The following snippet shows conceptually what the benchmark loop looks like for each approach:

```cpp
// Conceptual benchmark structure:
// for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
//     // epoll: pread(fd, buf, 4096, random_offset); // 1 syscall per read
//     // io_uring: prep_read + batch submit every 32 ops // ~1 syscall per 32 reads
// }
// io_uring wins by ~3-4x on NVMe, less on slow disks (I/O bound, not CPU bound)
```

The last line is an important caveat. If your bottleneck is actual disk latency rather than syscall overhead, io_uring's advantage shrinks. Slow spinning disks spend 5-10 ms per seek regardless of how you submit the request, so reducing syscall overhead from microseconds to zero is irrelevant in that regime.

## Notes

- Complementary to #640 (basic setup + completion) and #551 (C++ RAII wrapper).
- SQPOLL requires `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability (or root) on kernels < 5.12.
- `io_uring_register_buffers()` pins pages for zero-copy DMA (huge perf win for NVMe).
- Linked SQEs: `sqe->flags |= IOSQE_IO_LINK` chains operations.
- io_uring is now used in production by: Seastar, Tokio (Rust), libev, and SPDK.
