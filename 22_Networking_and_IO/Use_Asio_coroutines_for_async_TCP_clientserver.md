## Topic Overview

The fundamental problem with callback-based async I/O is that the logical flow of a request gets shredded into dozens of small lambda fragments. The sequence "connect, then write, then read" becomes three nested callbacks, and error handling has to be duplicated or carefully threaded through each one. C++20 coroutines with Asio solve this directly: you write the code top-to-bottom like synchronous code, and `co_await` is the point where the coroutine suspends and hands control back to the event loop. The result reads naturally but runs asynchronously. This topic focuses on the client side and error handling, complementing #729 (server + thread pool) and #550 (echo server + timers).

Here is the contrast that motivates everything:

```cpp
Callback-based (hard to follow):
  async_connect(ep, [](auto ec) {
      if (ec) return;
      async_write(sock, buf, [](auto ec, auto n) {
          if (ec) return;
          async_read(sock, buf, [](auto ec, auto n) {
              // callback hell!
          });
      });
  });

Coroutine-based (reads like synchronous code):
  co_await async_connect(sock, ep, use_awaitable);
  co_await async_write(sock, buf, use_awaitable);
  co_await async_read(sock, buf, use_awaitable);
```

The coroutine version is not just prettier - it is genuinely easier to reason about, because the control flow is linear. Error handling with `try/catch` works exactly as you'd expect, and you can use normal local variables across suspension points without any gymnastics.

| Approach | Readability | Error handling | Performance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Callbacks | Poor (nested) | Error codes in each callback | Best |
| Futures | Medium | exception from .get() | Overhead |
| Coroutines | Best (sequential) | try/catch around co_await | Excellent |

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Async echo client with co_await

This is the basic pattern for an async TCP client written as a coroutine. Notice how it reads almost exactly like a synchronous blocking client - the difference is that `co_await` makes each operation non-blocking under the hood. The `io.run()` at the end is what actually drives the event loop and allows all the suspended coroutines to make progress:

```cpp
// Requires: Asio (standalone or Boost) + C++20 compiler
// Compile: g++ -std=c++20 -fcoroutines -I/path/to/asio -lpthread client.cpp
#include <asio.hpp>
#include <asio/co_spawn.hpp>
#include <asio/use_awaitable.hpp>
#include <iostream>

using asio::ip::tcp;
using asio::use_awaitable;

asio::awaitable<void> echo_client(asio::io_context& io) {
    // Resolve the server address
    tcp::resolver resolver(io);
    auto endpoints = co_await resolver.async_resolve(
        "127.0.0.1", "8080", use_awaitable);

    // Connect
    tcp::socket socket(io);
    co_await asio::async_connect(socket, endpoints, use_awaitable);
    std::cout << "Connected to server\n";

    // Send a message
    std::string message = "Hello from coroutine client!\n";
    co_await asio::async_write(
        socket, asio::buffer(message), use_awaitable);
    std::cout << "Sent: " << message;

    // Read the echo response
    char reply[1024];
    size_t n = co_await socket.async_read_some(
        asio::buffer(reply), use_awaitable);
    std::cout << "Received: " << std::string(reply, n) << '\n';

    // Socket closed automatically (RAII) when coroutine exits
}

int main() {
    asio::io_context io;

    // co_spawn launches the coroutine on the io_context
    asio::co_spawn(io, echo_client(io), [](std::exception_ptr ep) {
        if (ep) {
            try { std::rethrow_exception(ep); }
            catch (const std::exception& e) {
                std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << '\n';
            }
        }
    });

    io.run();  // drives the event loop
}
// Test: first start an echo server on port 8080, then run this client
```

The socket closing via RAII is a small but important detail. When the coroutine function returns (or throws), the `tcp::socket` destructor runs automatically and closes the connection. You don't need an explicit `socket.close()` call unless you want to close early.

### Q2: Error handling with try/catch around co_await

In coroutine-based Asio code, errors from `co_await` arrive as `asio::system_error` exceptions. You can wrap individual operations or groups of operations in `try/catch` blocks, making the error-handling structure match the logical structure of your code rather than being scattered across callbacks:

```cpp
#include <asio.hpp>
#include <asio/co_spawn.hpp>
#include <asio/use_awaitable.hpp>
#include <iostream>
#include <chrono>

using asio::ip::tcp;
using asio::use_awaitable;

asio::awaitable<void> robust_client(asio::io_context& io) {
    tcp::socket socket(io);

    // Error handling: each co_await can throw system_error
    try {
        // Connect with timeout using parallel awaiting
        tcp::resolver resolver(io);
        auto endpoints = co_await resolver.async_resolve(
            "127.0.0.1", "8080", use_awaitable);

        co_await asio::async_connect(socket, endpoints, use_awaitable);
        std::cout << "Connected!\n";

    } catch (const asio::system_error& e) {
        std::cerr << "Connection failed: " << e.what() << '\n';
        co_return;  // exit coroutine cleanly
    }

    // Read/write with error handling
    try {
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
            std::string msg = "Message " + std::to_string(i) + "\n";
            co_await asio::async_write(
                socket, asio::buffer(msg), use_awaitable);

            char buf[1024];
            size_t n = co_await socket.async_read_some(
                asio::buffer(buf), use_awaitable);
            std::cout << "Reply: " << std::string(buf, n);
        }
    } catch (const asio::system_error& e) {
        if (e.code() == asio::error::eof) {
            std::cout << "Server closed connection\n";
        } else {
            std::cerr << "I/O error: " << e.what() << '\n';
        }
    }
    // socket destructor closes the connection (RAII)
}

int main() {
    asio::io_context io;
    asio::co_spawn(io, robust_client(io), asio::detached);
    io.run();
}
```

The reason for splitting connection and I/O into separate `try` blocks is that they need different recovery strategies. A connection failure means the socket is in an unusable state and you should bail out with `co_return`. An I/O error after successful connection might mean the server closed the stream (EOF is normal) or something actually went wrong, so you handle those two cases separately.

### Q3: co_spawn integrates coroutines into io_context

`asio::co_spawn` is the bridge that registers a coroutine with the event loop. Understanding how it works explains why nothing happens until you call `io.run()`:

```cpp
asio::co_spawn(executor, coroutine, completion_token)
  |
  v

1. Creates the coroutine frame (heap allocation)
2. Registers it with the executor (io_context)
3. Resumes the coroutine when async ops complete
4. Calls completion_token when coroutine finishes/throws
```

There are three ways to handle the completion, and the right one depends on whether you care about the result:

```cpp
#include <asio.hpp>
#include <asio/co_spawn.hpp>
#include <asio/use_awaitable.hpp>
#include <iostream>

using asio::use_awaitable;

asio::awaitable<int> compute() {
    // This coroutine runs on the io_context's thread
    asio::steady_timer timer(co_await asio::this_coro::executor,
                             std::chrono::seconds(1));
    co_await timer.async_wait(use_awaitable);
    co_return 42;
}

int main() {
    asio::io_context io;

    // Option 1: detached (fire and forget)
    asio::co_spawn(io, compute(), asio::detached);

    // Option 2: callback on completion
    asio::co_spawn(io, compute(), [](std::exception_ptr ep, int result) {
        if (ep) {
            try { std::rethrow_exception(ep); }
            catch (const std::exception& e) {
                std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << '\n';
            }
        } else {
            std::cout << "Result: " << result << '\n';  // 42
        }
    });

    // Option 3: use_future (C++20)
    // auto fut = asio::co_spawn(io, compute(), asio::use_future);
    // io.run();
    // std::cout << fut.get() << '\n';

    io.run();  // MUST call run() to drive the event loop!
    // Without run(): nothing happens (coroutine is suspended, never resumed)
}
```

**Key points about co_spawn:**

- The coroutine starts executing immediately until the first `co_await`.
- After `co_await`, the coroutine is suspended and control returns to `io.run()`.
- When the async operation completes, `io.run()` resumes the coroutine.
- Multiple coroutines can be co_spawned - they run concurrently on the same thread.
- `asio::detached` ignores the result; use a callback to capture it.

The forgetting-to-call-`io.run()` mistake is extremely common. The program compiles, `co_spawn` returns without error, and absolutely nothing happens. The event loop never runs, the coroutine never resumes, and the program exits immediately. Always make sure `io.run()` actually gets called.

## Notes

- Complementary to #729 (echo server + thread pool) and #550 (echo server + timeouts).
- `use_awaitable` makes async ops return awaitables (co_await-compatible).
- Coroutine frame allocation: Asio uses allocator-awareness to reduce heap allocs.
- For cancellation: use `asio::cancellation_signal` + `asio::bind_cancellation_slot`.
- GCC: needs `-fcoroutines`; Clang: needs `-stdlib=libc++`; MSVC: works by default.
