## Topic Overview

The Networking TS (Technical Specification, N4771) proposes a standard async networking API heavily based on Asio. While not yet in the standard, Asio serves as the reference implementation. The API surface: `io_context`, `tcp::acceptor`, `tcp::socket`, `async_read`, `async_write`.

If you have ever used Node.js or Python's `asyncio`, the mental model here is very similar: there is an event loop (`io_context`) that drives all the async operations, and you register callbacks (or coroutines) that run when I/O completes. The difference from raw epoll is that all the bookkeeping - registering interest, handling partial reads, managing lifetime - is done by the library, not by you.

```cpp
Networking TS architecture:

  io_context (event loop)            Proactor pattern
  +------------------+              +-------------------+
  | run()            | <----------- | completion handler|
  | poll()           |   callback   | or coroutine      |
  | stop()           |              +-------------------+
  +------------------+
        |
  +-----+------+------+
  | acceptor   | timer | socket |   I/O objects
  | async_     | async_| async_ |
  | accept()   | wait()| read() |
  +-----+------+------+--------+

  Relationship to std::execution:
  Networking TS:   io_context = scheduler, async ops = senders
  Proposed: integrate with sender/receiver (P2300)
```

You will mostly be using Asio today since the TS is not yet part of the standard. The good news is that the Networking TS is essentially Asio, so code you write now with `asio::` will require minimal changes if and when `std::net::` ships.

| Component | Networking TS | Asio equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Event loop | `std::net::io_context` | `asio::io_context` |
| TCP acceptor | `std::net::ip::tcp::acceptor` | `asio::ip::tcp::acceptor` |
| TCP socket | `std::net::ip::tcp::socket` | `asio::ip::tcp::socket` |
| Endpoint | `std::net::ip::tcp::endpoint` | `asio::ip::tcp::endpoint` |
| Async read | `std::net::async_read()` | `asio::async_read()` |
| Buffer | `std::net::buffer()` | `asio::buffer()` |

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Networking TS API surface

Let's walk through the core types before looking at code. Understanding what each piece does makes the subsequent examples much easier to follow.

**`io_context`** - The event loop / scheduler:

- Runs async operations to completion.
- `run()`: blocks and processes handlers until no work remains.
- `poll()`: runs ready handlers without blocking.
- `stop()`: interrupts `run()`.
- Thread-safe: multiple threads can call `run()` concurrently.

**`tcp::acceptor`** - Listens for incoming connections:

- `open()`, `bind()`, `listen()` - or construct with endpoint.
- `accept()` / `async_accept()` - returns a connected socket.

**`tcp::socket`** - A connected TCP stream:

- `connect()` / `async_connect()` - initiate outbound connection.
- `read_some()` / `async_read_some()` - read available data.
- `write_some()` / `async_write_some()` - write data.
- Composed operations: `async_read()`, `async_write()` read/write exact amounts.

**`tcp::endpoint`** - IP address + port:

- `tcp::endpoint(ip::address_v4::any(), 8080)` - listen on all interfaces.
- `tcp::resolver` - DNS resolution (also async).

Here is the synchronous version first, which is the simplest way to see the API surface before layering in async callbacks:

```cpp
// Using Asio as Networking TS reference implementation
// Compile: g++ -std=c++20 -I/path/to/asio/include -DASIO_STANDALONE net_ts.cpp
#include <asio.hpp>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // io_context: the event loop
    asio::io_context ctx;

    // tcp::acceptor: listen on port 8080
    asio::ip::tcp::acceptor acceptor(
        ctx, {asio::ip::tcp::v4(), 8080});

    std::cout << "Listening on port 8080...\n";

    // Accept one connection (synchronous)
    asio::ip::tcp::socket sock(ctx);
    acceptor.accept(sock);

    std::cout << "Connected: " << sock.remote_endpoint() << '\n';

    // Read some data
    char buf[256];
    std::error_code ec;
    size_t n = sock.read_some(asio::buffer(buf), ec);
    if (!ec) {
        std::cout << "Received: ";
        std::cout.write(buf, n);
    }

    // Write response
    asio::write(sock, asio::buffer("Hello from Networking TS!\n"));
}
```

Notice how `asio::buffer()` wraps your raw buffer so the library knows its size. The composed `asio::write()` keeps writing until all bytes are sent, unlike the raw `write_some()` which may send fewer.

### Q2: Minimal TCP echo server

The async version uses a `Session` class that keeps itself alive via `shared_from_this()` while an async operation is in flight. This is the standard Asio lifetime management idiom and it trips people up at first, so it is worth understanding why it is needed.

The reason is that async operations complete later - potentially after the code that started them has returned from the stack. The callback holds a shared_ptr to the Session, which keeps the object alive until the callback runs. Without that, the Session object could be destroyed while the kernel still has a pending operation referencing its buffer:

```cpp
// Async echo server using Asio (Networking TS reference)
#include <asio.hpp>
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

using asio::ip::tcp;

class Session : public std::enable_shared_from_this<Session> {
public:
    explicit Session(tcp::socket socket)
        : socket_(std::move(socket)) {}

    void start() { do_read(); }

private:
    void do_read() {
        auto self = shared_from_this();
        socket_.async_read_some(
            asio::buffer(buf_),
            [self](std::error_code ec, size_t len) {
                if (!ec) self->do_write(len);
            });
    }

    void do_write(size_t len) {
        auto self = shared_from_this();
        asio::async_write(
            socket_, asio::buffer(buf_, len),
            [self](std::error_code ec, size_t) {
                if (!ec) self->do_read();  // echo loop
            });
    }

    tcp::socket socket_;
    char buf_[1024];
};

class Server {
public:
    Server(asio::io_context& ctx, unsigned short port)
        : acceptor_(ctx, {tcp::v4(), port}) {
        do_accept();
    }

private:
    void do_accept() {
        acceptor_.async_accept(
            [this](std::error_code ec, tcp::socket socket) {
                if (!ec) {
                    std::make_shared<Session>(std::move(socket))->start();
                }
                do_accept();  // accept next connection
            });
    }

    tcp::acceptor acceptor_;
};

int main() {
    asio::io_context ctx;
    Server server(ctx, 8080);
    std::cout << "Echo server on port 8080\n";
    ctx.run();  // blocks, processes all async ops
}
// Test: echo "hello" | nc localhost 8080
```

Each `Session` is a heap-allocated object that lives exactly as long as the connection is active. When `do_read()` sees an error (including clean disconnect), it does not reschedule the next read, so the last shared_ptr holding the Session drops, the destructor runs, and the socket closes. The `Server` object just loops calling `do_accept()` indefinitely.

### Q3: Networking TS and std::execution senders

The Networking TS and `std::execution` (P2300 senders/receivers) are converging. If you are wondering why the Networking TS has not been merged into the standard yet despite being around for years, this is why - the committee wants async operations to integrate cleanly with `std::execution` rather than having two separate async models.

**Current Networking TS (callback-based):**

```cpp
socket.async_read_some(buffer, [](error_code ec, size_t n) {
    // completion handler (callback)
});
```

**Future integration with senders:**

```cpp
// Proposed: async operations return senders
auto sender = socket.async_read_some(buffer, asio::use_sender);
// Can be composed with std::execution algorithms:
auto pipeline = std::execution::then(sender, [](size_t n) {
    return process(n);
});
std::execution::sync_wait(pipeline);
```

The sender model is more composable - you can chain operations, add timeouts, and handle cancellation uniformly. The callback model works but leads to deeply nested code ("callback hell") when you chain many async operations. Coroutines (`co_await`) already solve the nesting problem with the current TS, but senders provide a library-level composition model that does not require language support.

| Concept | Networking TS | std::execution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Event loop | `io_context` | `run_loop` / scheduler |
| Async operation | `async_read()` + callback | sender |
| Composition | Nested callbacks / coroutines | `then`, `when_all`, `let_value` |
| Cancellation | `socket.cancel()` | `stop_token` |
| Error handling | `error_code` parameter | `set_error` channel |

**Current status (2024):**

- Networking TS is NOT in C++23 or C++26.
- `std::execution` (P2300) is in C++26.
- The plan: redefine networking async ops as senders.
- Use Asio now; it already supports `asio::use_awaitable` (coroutines) and experimental sender support.

---

## Notes

- Asio IS the reference implementation for Networking TS. Use it now.
- `asio::use_awaitable` turns any async op into a coroutine awaitable (C++20).
- `asio::deferred` creates composable async operations.
- For production: Asio, Boost.Beast (HTTP/WebSocket on Asio), or libcurl.
- The Networking TS delay is because the committee wants sender/receiver integration first.
