# Advanced Debugging Techniques

Systematic debugging methodology for C++ systems: debugging optimized code, time-travel debugging, custom visualizers, coroutine debugging, post-mortem analysis, and remote debugging.

## Notes

- GDB/LLDB pretty-printers format std::vector, std::map, etc. — install them for readable debugging
- Conditional breakpoints (reak if x > 100) reduce noise when debugging loops
- Watchpoints halt execution when a memory address changes — essential for tracking mysterious mutations
- r (record and replay) allows reverse debugging — step backwards through execution
- ASan + UBSan in debug builds catch issues at the exact point of occurrence
- Core dumps + symbols enable post-mortem debugging — configure ulimit -c unlimited on Linux
- Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry) helps debug issues across microservice boundaries
- std::stacktrace (C++23) provides programmatic stack traces without platform-specific code
- Debugging optimized code requires understanding that variables may be optimized out — use olatile hints
- Memory debugging tools (Valgrind, Dr. Memory) find leaks and corruption the sanitizers may miss
