## Notes

- C++20 coroutines are stackless — each coroutine has a heap-allocated frame
- co_await, co_yield, and co_return are the three coroutine keywords
- A coroutine requires a promise type that controls its behavior (return, suspend, resume)
- std::generator (C++23) is the standard lazy sequence generator built on coroutines
- Coroutine handles (std::coroutine_handle) manage coroutine lifetime — destroy them to avoid leaks
- initial_suspend and inal_suspend control when a coroutine first suspends and finishes
- Custom awaitables implement wait_ready, wait_suspend, wait_resume for custom scheduling
- Symmetric transfer (wait_suspend returning a coroutine_handle) avoids stack overflow in chains
- Coroutine allocations can be elided by the compiler (HALO optimization) in ideal cases
- Error handling in coroutines uses unhandled_exception() in the promise type
