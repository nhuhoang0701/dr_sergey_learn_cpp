# Use strong typedefs and phantom types to prevent parameter confusion

**Category:** OOP Design

## Topic Overview

**Strong typedefs** create distinct types from the same underlying type, catching misuse at compile time. The problem they solve is real and surprisingly common: when two parameters have the same underlying type, nothing stops you from passing them in the wrong order.

```cpp
Weak (dangerous):   void transfer(int from, int to, int amount);
                    transfer(amount, to, from);  // Compiles! Silent bug!

Strong (safe):      void transfer(AccountId from, AccountId to, Money amount);
                    transfer(amount, to, from);  // COMPILE ERROR!
```

The reason this trips people up is that `int` carries no semantic meaning. Two `int` parameters called `from` and `to` look safe in the function signature, but every call site is a trap - the compiler is happy to silently swap them. Strong types encode the semantics into the type itself, so the compiler enforces correctness at every call site automatically. The great news is that all of these techniques have zero runtime cost - the wrapper vanishes at compile time and you're left with a raw value, just as efficient as the original `int`.

| Technique | Overhead | Conversion | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enum class` | Zero | Explicit | `enum class UserId : int {};` |
| Wrapper struct | Zero (optimized away) | Explicit | `struct Meters { double value; };` |
| `std::strong_typedef` (proposed) | Zero | Explicit | Not yet in standard |
| Phantom types (template tag) | Zero | Tag-based | `Id<UserTag>` vs `Id<OrderTag>` |

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Create strong typedefs using wrapper structs and enum class

Two techniques are shown here. The wrapper struct approach uses a template with a tag type to generate a whole family of distinct ID types from a single template. The `enum class` approach is even simpler - the underlying type is just `int`, but the named type is incompatible with raw integers and with other enum classes, so swaps are caught at compile time. Notice how the tags themselves are just empty structs - they exist purely to make the types distinct:

**Answer:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <compare>
#include <string>
#include <functional>

// Method 1: Wrapper struct (most common)
template<typename Tag, typename T = int>
struct StrongId {
    T value;

    explicit constexpr StrongId(T v) : value(v) {}
    auto operator<=>(const StrongId&) const = default;
};

// Define distinct ID types with tags
struct UserTag {};
struct OrderTag {};
struct ProductTag {};

using UserId    = StrongId<UserTag>;
using OrderId   = StrongId<OrderTag>;
using ProductId = StrongId<ProductTag>;

// Hash support for use in containers
template<typename Tag, typename T>
struct std::hash<StrongId<Tag, T>> {
    size_t operator()(const StrongId<Tag, T>& id) const {
        return std::hash<T>{}(id.value);
    }
};

// Method 2: enum class for zero-cost distinct types
enum class Meters : int {};
enum class Feet : int {};
enum class Seconds : int {};

void navigate(Meters distance, Seconds time) {
    std::cout << "Distance: " << static_cast<int>(distance)
              << "m, Time: " << static_cast<int>(time) << "s\n";
}

void process_order(UserId user, OrderId order) {
    std::cout << "User " << user.value << " order " << order.value << "\n";
}

int main() {
    UserId uid(42);
    OrderId oid(100);
    // process_order(oid, uid);  // COMPILE ERROR! Types don't match
    process_order(uid, oid);     // OK

    // navigate(Seconds{10}, Meters{100});  // COMPILE ERROR!
    navigate(Meters{100}, Seconds{10});     // OK
    return 0;
}
```

The tags (`UserTag`, `OrderTag`) are empty structs that exist purely to make the types distinct. At runtime, they're completely gone - the compiler optimizes the wrapper away and you pay no overhead. The `explicit` constructor means you can't accidentally create a `UserId` from a bare integer without saying so deliberately. If you try to swap `uid` and `oid` in the call, the compiler immediately tells you the types don't match.

### Q2: Build a comprehensive unit-safe type with arithmetic

This example goes further - it builds a quantity type where the unit is part of the type, so mixing meters and seconds in arithmetic is a compile error. The cross-unit `operator/` between `Meter` and `Second` returns a `Velocity`, encoding the physics in the type system. User-defined literals make the syntax ergonomic so you can write `100.0_m` instead of `Meter(100.0)`:

**Answer:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <ratio>
#include <type_traits>

// Physical quantity with unit tag
template<typename Unit>
class Quantity {
    double value_;
public:
    constexpr explicit Quantity(double v) : value_(v) {}
    constexpr double value() const { return value_; }

    // Same-unit arithmetic
    constexpr Quantity operator+(Quantity o) const { return Quantity(value_ + o.value_); }
    constexpr Quantity operator-(Quantity o) const { return Quantity(value_ - o.value_); }
    constexpr Quantity operator*(double s) const { return Quantity(value_ * s); }
    constexpr auto operator<=>(const Quantity&) const = default;
};

// Unit tags
struct MeterTag {};
struct KilogramTag {};
struct SecondTag {};

using Meter    = Quantity<MeterTag>;
using Kilogram = Quantity<KilogramTag>;
using Second   = Quantity<SecondTag>;

// Cross-unit operations return different types
struct VelocityTag {};
using Velocity = Quantity<VelocityTag>;

constexpr Velocity operator/(Meter d, Second t) {
    return Velocity(d.value() / t.value());
}

// UDLs for ergonomics
constexpr Meter operator""_m(long double v) { return Meter(static_cast<double>(v)); }
constexpr Second operator""_s(long double v) { return Second(static_cast<double>(v)); }
constexpr Kilogram operator""_kg(long double v) { return Kilogram(static_cast<double>(v)); }

int main() {
    auto distance = 100.0_m;
    auto time = 9.58_s;
    auto speed = distance / time;
    std::cout << "Speed: " << speed.value() << " m/s\n";

    // auto bad = distance + time;  // COMPILE ERROR! Can't add meters + seconds
    auto total = distance + 50.0_m;  // OK: same units
    std::cout << "Total: " << total.value() << " m\n";
    return 0;
}
```

The standard library's `<chrono>` does exactly this - `std::chrono::seconds` and `std::chrono::milliseconds` are distinct types, and you can't accidentally add a duration to a time point without the type system complaining. This example shows the same principle applied to physical units. The line `auto bad = distance + time` does not compile, and that is a feature - the type system caught a units mismatch that would have been a silent numerical error at runtime.

### Q3: Show phantom types for state-machine type safety

Phantom types take strong typing to the extreme: the type parameter carries state information but has no runtime representation at all. Here, a `Connection<Disconnected>` and a `Connection<Connected>` have exactly the same data layout - the tag is purely compile-time. But because `send_data` requires `Connection<Authenticated>`, you literally cannot call it on an unauthenticated connection - the compiler won't let you. This turns illegal protocol usage into a compile error rather than a runtime crash:

**Answer:**

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <iostream>

// Phantom type tags for connection states
struct Disconnected {};
struct Connected {};
struct Authenticated {};

template<typename State>
class Connection {
    std::string host_;
    std::string token_;

    // Private constructor: only transitions create new states
    Connection(std::string host, std::string token)
        : host_(std::move(host)), token_(std::move(token)) {}

    template<typename> friend class Connection;  // Allow state transitions

public:
    // Initial state: only way to create
    static Connection<Disconnected> create(std::string host) {
        return Connection<Disconnected>(std::move(host), "");
    }
};

// State transitions: each returns a different phantom type
template<>
Connection<Connected> Connection<Disconnected>::connect() {
    std::cout << "Connecting to " << host_ << "\n";
    return Connection<Connected>(host_, "");
}
// ... but we need explicit specialization. Simpler approach:

// Free functions enforce legal transitions
Connection<Connected> connect(Connection<Disconnected> c) {
    std::cout << "Connected!\n";
    return Connection<Connected>::create("host");  // Simplified
}

Connection<Authenticated> authenticate(Connection<Connected> c, const std::string& token) {
    std::cout << "Authenticated!\n";
    return Connection<Authenticated>::create("host");
}

void send_data(const Connection<Authenticated>& conn, const std::string& data) {
    std::cout << "Sending: " << data << "\n";
}

int main() {
    auto c1 = Connection<Disconnected>::create("192.168.1.1");
    // send_data(c1, "hello");  // COMPILE ERROR: not authenticated!

    auto c2 = connect(std::move(c1));
    // send_data(c2, "hello");  // COMPILE ERROR: not authenticated!

    auto c3 = authenticate(std::move(c2), "secret");
    send_data(c3, "hello");    // OK: fully authenticated
    return 0;
}
```

The nice thing about phantom types for state machines is that illegal state transitions become impossible to express in code, not just illegal by convention. You can't call `send_data` and then add `// TODO: authenticate first` - the code simply won't compile until the state machine is followed correctly. The type system is doing the enforcement for you, for free, with no runtime checks whatsoever.

## Notes

- Strong typedefs have **zero runtime cost** - the compiler optimizes away the wrapper struct and you're left with a raw value, just like if you'd used `int` directly.
- `enum class : int` is the simplest technique for opaque IDs; use wrapper structs when you need arithmetic operators or custom behavior.
- Phantom types encode state-machine transitions in the type system, making illegal states into compile errors rather than runtime bugs.
- The `<chrono>` library is the gold standard example of unit-safe types in the standard library - study it if you want to see a production-quality version of the Quantity pattern.
- Don't overuse strong types everywhere: they shine at API boundaries (public interfaces, function parameters) where the cost of a mistake is high. Internal calculations that are obviously typed don't need this treatment.
- A proposed `std::strong_typedef` may arrive in a future standard; until then, the wrapper struct template is the idiomatic approach.
