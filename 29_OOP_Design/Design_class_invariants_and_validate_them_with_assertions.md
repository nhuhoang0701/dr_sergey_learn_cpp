# Design class invariants and validate them with assertions

**Category:** OOP Design

---

## Topic Overview

A **class invariant** is a condition that must always hold true between public method calls. Think of it as a promise the class makes to the rest of the world: "at any observable moment, these conditions are guaranteed." The class is allowed to temporarily break the invariant during a method's execution - that's expected - but it must restore it before the method returns.

```cpp
Constructor -> establishes invariant
  |
Public method -> may temporarily break invariant
  |                 during execution, but MUST
Method returns -> restore invariant before returning
  |
Destructor -> invariant holds for the last time
```

The practical value of invariants is enormous. When you can say "the data in this object is always sorted and never has duplicates," you can use faster algorithms, skip defensive checks in many places, and reason about correctness much more easily. The hard question is how to express and enforce them, and that depends on what you're guarding against:

| Assertion Type | When | Cost | Production |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `assert()` | Debug only | Zero in release | Compiled out |
| `static_assert` | Compile time | **Zero** | Always |
| Exceptions | Runtime | Non-zero | Active |
| Contracts (C++26) | Configurable | Configurable | Configurable |

The key distinction is: use `assert` for things that should never happen (programmer bugs), and use exceptions for things that can happen due to bad input from outside the class.

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Design a class with documented and enforced invariants

Here's a `SortedSet` that guarantees three things at all times: the data is sorted, there are no duplicates, and the size never exceeds a maximum capacity. The private `check_invariant()` method makes these conditions testable, and the `assert` calls at entry and exit of each mutating method act as an automated check during development.

**Answer:**

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cassert>
#include <algorithm>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <iostream>

// Invariants:
// 1. data_ is always sorted
// 2. data_ contains no duplicates
// 3. size() <= max_capacity_
class SortedSet {
    std::vector<int> data_;
    size_t max_capacity_;

    // Private invariant checker
    bool check_invariant() const {
        // Sorted?
        for (size_t i = 1; i < data_.size(); ++i)
            if (data_[i-1] >= data_[i]) return false;
        // Capacity?
        return data_.size() <= max_capacity_;
    }

public:
    explicit SortedSet(size_t max_cap)
        : max_capacity_(max_cap) {
        assert(max_cap > 0 && "Capacity must be positive");
        assert(check_invariant());
    }

    bool insert(int value) {
        assert(check_invariant());  // Pre-condition

        if (data_.size() >= max_capacity_)
            return false;

        auto it = std::lower_bound(data_.begin(), data_.end(), value);
        if (it != data_.end() && *it == value)
            return false;  // Duplicate

        data_.insert(it, value);

        assert(check_invariant());  // Post-condition
        return true;
    }

    bool contains(int value) const {
        return std::binary_search(data_.begin(), data_.end(), value);
    }

    bool remove(int value) {
        assert(check_invariant());
        auto it = std::lower_bound(data_.begin(), data_.end(), value);
        if (it == data_.end() || *it != value) return false;
        data_.erase(it);
        assert(check_invariant());
        return true;
    }

    size_t size() const { return data_.size(); }
};

int main() {
    SortedSet s(5);
    s.insert(3); s.insert(1); s.insert(2);
    std::cout << s.contains(2) << "\n";  // true
    std::cout << s.insert(2) << "\n";    // false (duplicate)
    return 0;
}
```

Because the data is always sorted, `contains` can use binary search instead of linear scan. That's the practical reward for maintaining the invariant: algorithms that would be unsafe on unsorted data become safe and fast here.

### Q2: Use defensive programming for untrusted inputs

There's an important split in where errors come from. Some errors are programmer mistakes - passing a negative interest rate when the contract says 0..1. Those should be `assert` because they shouldn't happen in production. Other errors come from external data - a user providing a negative initial balance. Those need exceptions because they can legitimately happen at runtime and the caller needs a chance to handle them.

**Answer:**

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>

class BankAccount {
    std::string owner_;
    double balance_;  // Invariant: balance_ >= 0

    void validate_invariant() const {
        assert(balance_ >= 0.0 && "Balance invariant violated!");
        assert(!owner_.empty() && "Owner invariant violated!");
    }

public:
    // BOUNDARY: validate untrusted input with exceptions
    BankAccount(const std::string& owner, double initial_balance) {
        if (owner.empty())
            throw std::invalid_argument("Owner name required");
        if (initial_balance < 0)
            throw std::invalid_argument("Initial balance must be >= 0");

        owner_ = owner;
        balance_ = initial_balance;
        validate_invariant();  // Established!
    }

    // BOUNDARY: public API validates with exceptions
    void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount <= 0)
            throw std::invalid_argument("Deposit must be positive");

        balance_ += amount;  // Can't break invariant (adding positive)
        validate_invariant();
    }

    void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount <= 0)
            throw std::invalid_argument("Withdrawal must be positive");
        if (amount > balance_)
            throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");

        balance_ -= amount;
        validate_invariant();
    }

    // INTERNAL: assert for programmer errors
    void apply_interest(double rate) {
        assert(rate >= 0.0 && rate <= 1.0 && "Rate must be 0..1");
        balance_ *= (1.0 + rate);
        validate_invariant();
    }

    double balance() const { return balance_; }
};

int main() {
    BankAccount acc("Alice", 1000);
    acc.deposit(500);
    acc.withdraw(200);
    acc.apply_interest(0.05);  // 5% interest
    std::cout << "Balance: " << acc.balance() << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

The design of `apply_interest` is deliberate: it asserts rather than throws because passing a rate outside 0..1 is a programming error, not a user error. If a developer passes `1.5` as a rate, that's a bug to be caught in testing, not a condition to handle gracefully in production.

### Q3: Show compile-time invariant checking

The best kind of invariant check is one that happens at compile time with zero runtime cost. If you can express your constraint as a `static_assert`, you get a hard compile error with a clear message the moment someone instantiates your template incorrectly.

**Answer:**

```cpp
#include <cstddef>
#include <array>
#include <type_traits>
#include <iostream>

// Compile-time invariant: buffer size must be power of two
template<size_t N>
class RingBuffer {
    static_assert(N > 0, "Buffer size must be positive");
    static_assert((N & (N - 1)) == 0, "Buffer size must be power of 2");

    std::array<int, N> data_{};
    size_t head_ = 0, tail_ = 0;

public:
    void push(int val) {
        data_[head_ & (N - 1)] = val;  // Fast modulo with power-of-2
        ++head_;
    }

    int pop() {
        return data_[tail_++ & (N - 1)];
    }

    size_t size() const { return head_ - tail_; }
};

// Compile-time type invariants
template<typename T>
class TypeSafeContainer {
    static_assert(std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<T>,
        "T must be nothrow-moveable for exception safety");
    static_assert(!std::is_reference_v<T>,
        "Container cannot hold references");
    static_assert(sizeof(T) <= 1024,
        "T too large for inline storage");

    T value_;
public:
    explicit TypeSafeContainer(T val) : value_(std::move(val)) {}
    const T& get() const { return value_; }
};

int main() {
    RingBuffer<64> buf;  // OK: 64 is power of 2
    // RingBuffer<100> bad;  // COMPILE ERROR: not power of 2

    buf.push(42);
    std::cout << buf.pop() << "\n";

    TypeSafeContainer<int> c(42);
    // TypeSafeContainer<int&> bad;  // COMPILE ERROR
    return 0;
}
```

The power-of-two constraint on `RingBuffer` is also what makes the fast-modulo trick work: `head_ & (N - 1)` only gives the correct index into the buffer when `N` is a power of two. So the `static_assert` isn't just documentation - it's guarding a correctness assumption that the algorithm depends on.

## Notes

- **Assertions for programmer errors** (internal bugs), **exceptions for runtime errors** (bad input).
- `assert()` is compiled out in release builds (`-DNDEBUG`) - zero cost in production.
- Check invariants at the **end of every public mutating method**.
- `static_assert` catches invariant violations at **compile time** - use it wherever possible.
- C++26 contracts (`pre`, `post`, `assert`) will formalize this - start thinking in terms of contracts now.
- Invariant checks during development catch bugs early; remove/disable in production for performance.
