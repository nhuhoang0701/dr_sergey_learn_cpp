# Design value types vs entity types and know when to use each

**Category:** OOP Design

---

## Topic Overview

C++ types fall into two fundamental design categories. The distinction sounds philosophical but has very concrete consequences for copy semantics, comparison operators, how you store things in containers, and how you pass them to functions.

| Aspect | Value Types | Entity Types |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Identity | Defined by **content** (two Points(3,4) are equal) | Defined by **identity** (two Users with same name are not the same user) |
| Copying | Deep copy (each copy is independent) | Non-copyable (unique identity) |
| Comparison | `==` compares content | `==` compares identity (pointer/ID) |
| Passing | By value or const& | By unique_ptr or reference |
| Storage | Stack or inline | Heap (polymorphic) or managed |
| Examples | `int`, `Point`, `Color`, `Money` | `DatabaseConnection`, `Thread`, `Window` |

### Rule of Thumb

When you're not sure which category a type belongs to, ask this question:

```cpp
Value type:  "Is this thing interchangeable with another identical thing?"
             YES -> value type (e.g., $10 bill is same as any other $10 bill)
             NO  -> entity type (e.g., your bank account is unique)
```

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Design a value type with proper semantics

A value type's defining characteristic is that two instances with the same content are interchangeable - like two $10 bills. That means equality should compare content, copies should be independent and meaningful, and arithmetic operators should return new values rather than modifying in place. The `Money` class below uses integer cents internally to avoid floating-point rounding, which is a common and important choice for financial values.

```cpp
#include <compare>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <format>

// Value type: Money
// - Compared by content (amount + currency)
// - Copied freely
// - Immutable or value-semantic mutations
class Money {
    int64_t cents_;          // Store as integer to avoid floating-point errors
    std::string currency_;   // "USD", "EUR", etc.

public:
    Money(double amount, std::string currency)
        : cents_(static_cast<int64_t>(std::round(amount * 100)))
        , currency_(std::move(currency)) {}

    static Money from_cents(int64_t cents, std::string currency) {
        Money m(0, std::move(currency));
        m.cents_ = cents;
        return m;
    }

    double amount() const { return cents_ / 100.0; }
    int64_t cents() const { return cents_; }
    const std::string& currency() const { return currency_; }

    // Value semantics: operators return NEW values
    Money operator+(const Money& other) const {
        if (currency_ != other.currency_)
            throw std::invalid_argument("Currency mismatch");
        return from_cents(cents_ + other.cents_, currency_);
    }

    Money operator-(const Money& other) const {
        if (currency_ != other.currency_)
            throw std::invalid_argument("Currency mismatch");
        return from_cents(cents_ - other.cents_, currency_);
    }

    Money operator*(double factor) const {
        return from_cents(static_cast<int64_t>(std::round(cents_ * factor)), currency_);
    }

    // Content-based comparison (C++20 spaceship)
    auto operator<=>(const Money& other) const {
        if (currency_ != other.currency_)
            throw std::invalid_argument("Currency mismatch");
        return cents_ <=> other.cents_;
    }

    bool operator==(const Money& other) const {
        return currency_ == other.currency_ && cents_ == other.cents_;
    }

    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const Money& m) {
        return os << m.currency_ << " " << m.amount();
    }
};

int main() {
    Money a(10.50, "USD");
    Money b(3.25, "USD");
    Money c = a + b;                  // New value
    std::cout << c << "\n";           // USD 13.75

    Money d = a;                      // Copy is fine - value type
    assert(a == d);                   // Equal by content
    assert(a + b > a);                // Comparable
    return 0;
}
```

### Q2: Design an entity type with proper move-only semantics

An entity type represents something with a unique existence in the world - a database connection, a file handle, a window. Two `DatabaseConnection` objects that connect to the same host are still two different connections. You can't copy a TCP connection (there's no protocol for it), so the copy constructor is deleted. You can transfer ownership with a move, though - that just means one object hands its socket file descriptor to another.

```cpp
#include <memory>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdint>

// Entity type: DatabaseConnection
// - Unique identity (each connection is different)
// - Non-copyable (can't duplicate a TCP connection)
// - Movable (transfer ownership)
class DatabaseConnection {
    uint64_t id_;          // Unique identity
    std::string host_;
    int fd_ = -1;          // OS resource (file descriptor)
    bool connected_ = false;

    static uint64_t next_id() {
        static uint64_t counter = 0;
        return ++counter;
    }

public:
    explicit DatabaseConnection(std::string host)
        : id_(next_id()), host_(std::move(host)) {}

    // Non-copyable! Each connection is a unique resource
    DatabaseConnection(const DatabaseConnection&) = delete;
    DatabaseConnection& operator=(const DatabaseConnection&) = delete;

    // Movable - transfer ownership
    DatabaseConnection(DatabaseConnection&& other) noexcept
        : id_(other.id_), host_(std::move(other.host_)),
          fd_(other.fd_), connected_(other.connected_) {
        other.fd_ = -1;
        other.connected_ = false;
    }

    DatabaseConnection& operator=(DatabaseConnection&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            disconnect();  // Release current resource
            id_ = other.id_;
            host_ = std::move(other.host_);
            fd_ = other.fd_;
            connected_ = other.connected_;
            other.fd_ = -1;
            other.connected_ = false;
        }
        return *this;
    }

    ~DatabaseConnection() { disconnect(); }

    bool connect() {
        // fd_ = ::connect(...);
        fd_ = 42;  // simulated
        connected_ = true;
        std::cout << "Connection #" << id_ << " to " << host_ << " opened\n";
        return true;
    }

    void disconnect() {
        if (connected_) {
            // ::close(fd_);
            std::cout << "Connection #" << id_ << " closed\n";
            fd_ = -1;
            connected_ = false;
        }
    }

    // Identity comparison - by ID, not by content
    bool operator==(const DatabaseConnection& other) const { return id_ == other.id_; }
    uint64_t id() const { return id_; }
};

// Entity types are typically managed via unique_ptr
class ConnectionPool {
    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<DatabaseConnection>> pool_;
public:
    DatabaseConnection& acquire(const std::string& host) {
        auto conn = std::make_unique<DatabaseConnection>(host);
        conn->connect();
        pool_.push_back(std::move(conn));
        return *pool_.back();
    }
};
```

### Q3: Show hybrid types and when the distinction matters for design decisions

Real-world types often blend both characteristics. A `User` has a unique identity (their user ID) but also carries data fields (name, email) that are value-like. The right answer is to compare by identity but allow copying for use as data transfer objects (DTOs) or snapshots. The decision framework below, expressed as inline comments, is the useful artifact here.

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <memory>
#include <variant>

// Decision framework
// Ask these questions:
// 1. "Are two instances with same data interchangeable?" -> Value
// 2. "Does it own a unique external resource?" -> Entity
// 3. "Should copying be meaningful?" -> Value
// 4. "Does it have lifecycle events (open/close)?" -> Entity

// Hybrid: Value-like entity
// User: has identity (user_id) but also value-like data
struct UserId { uint64_t value; auto operator<=>(const UserId&) const = default; };

class User {
    UserId id_;              // Identity (entity aspect)
    std::string name_;       // Data (value aspect)
    std::string email_;

public:
    User(UserId id, std::string name, std::string email)
        : id_(id), name_(std::move(name)), email_(std::move(email)) {}

    // Entity comparison: by identity, NOT by name/email
    bool operator==(const User& other) const { return id_ == other.id_; }

    // But the data is copyable (for snapshots, DTOs, etc.)
    UserId id() const { return id_; }
    const std::string& name() const { return name_; }

    void rename(std::string new_name) { name_ = std::move(new_name); }
};

// Impact on container choice:
// Value types: store directly
std::vector<Money> prices;              // Copy-friendly, stack-allocated

// Entity types: store via pointer (unique ownership)
std::vector<std::unique_ptr<DatabaseConnection>> connections;

// Hybrid: depends on usage
std::vector<User> user_list;            // Snapshot/DTO - copy is fine
std::map<UserId, std::unique_ptr<User>> user_registry;  // Canonical store

// Impact on function signatures:
// Value: pass by value or const&
double total(std::span<const Money> prices);      // Read values

// Entity: pass by reference (never copy)
void execute(DatabaseConnection& conn, std::string_view sql);  // Use resource

// Transfer entity ownership:
void register_connection(std::unique_ptr<DatabaseConnection> conn);
```

The container choice section is where this distinction pays off most visibly. Value types live directly in `std::vector`, entity types live behind `unique_ptr`. Getting this right from the start avoids a lot of painful refactoring later.

## Notes

- **Default to value types** - they're simpler, thread-safe (when immutable), and cache-friendly.
- Entity types almost always need Rule of Five (or Rule of Zero with unique_ptr members).
- Value types should use `auto operator<=>(const T&) const = default;` (C++20).
- In domain-driven design: **Value Objects** (Money, Address) vs **Entities** (User, Order) map directly.
- The `=delete` on copy constructor is the clearest signal that a type is an entity.
- Use `std::unique_ptr<Entity>` for ownership, raw pointer/reference for non-owning access.
