# Implement the CRTP for static polymorphism and mixin classes

**Category:** OOP Design

---

## Topic Overview

**CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern)** is one of those C++ tricks that looks bizarre the first time you see it. The idea is that a class `Derived` inherits from `Base<Derived>` - the derived class passes itself as a template argument to its own base. This lets the base class call methods on the derived class at compile time, giving you virtual-dispatch-like polymorphism with zero runtime overhead.

```cpp
template<typename Derived>
class Base {
    void interface() {
        static_cast<Derived*>(this)->implementation();  // Compile-time dispatch
    }
};
class Concrete : public Base<Concrete> {
    void implementation() { /* ... */ }
};
```

The `static_cast<Derived*>(this)` is the key move. Here's why it's safe: because `Base<Derived>` is instantiated with the exact concrete type at compile time, the cast doesn't guess - it knows. The call resolves directly to the derived method with no vtable lookup, no indirection, and no runtime overhead whatsoever. The reason this trips people up is that `Base<Derived>` is a different type than `Base<Other>`, so you can't put a `Circle` and a `Rectangle` into the same `std::vector<Shape<?>*>` - that's the fundamental trade-off compared to virtual polymorphism.

### CRTP Use Cases

| Use Case | What CRTP provides |
| --- | --- |
| Static polymorphism | Virtual-like dispatch at zero cost |
| Mixin classes | Add functionality via base class |
| Expression templates | Build expression trees at compile time |
| Operator generation | Auto-generate `!=`, `>`, `<=` from `==` and `<` |
| Singleton | Templated singleton base |

### Q1: Implement CRTP for zero-overhead static polymorphism

Here's the core CRTP shape pattern. Each shape type inherits from `Shape<itself>`, and the base class calls derived methods through `static_cast`. The resulting `process_shape` function is a template that accepts any shape type - but because the dispatch is resolved at compile time, the compiler can inline everything. Pay attention to how the base class never needs to know anything about `Circle` or `Rectangle` specifically - the template parameter does all the work.

**Answer:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>
#include <chrono>

// CRTP base: static interface
template<typename Derived>
class Shape {
public:
    double area() const {
        return static_cast<const Derived*>(this)->area_impl();
    }

    void draw() const {
        std::cout << "Drawing " << static_cast<const Derived*>(this)->name()
                  << " (area=" << area() << ")\n";
        static_cast<const Derived*>(this)->draw_impl();
    }

    // Mixin: add functionality to all shapes for free
    double perimeter_to_area_ratio() const {
        return static_cast<const Derived*>(this)->perimeter_impl() / area();
    }
};

class Circle : public Shape<Circle> {
    double r_;
    friend class Shape<Circle>;

    double area_impl() const { return M_PI * r_ * r_; }
    double perimeter_impl() const { return 2 * M_PI * r_; }
    void draw_impl() const { std::cout << "  circle radius=" << r_ << "\n"; }
    const char* name() const { return "Circle"; }

public:
    explicit Circle(double r) : r_(r) {}
};

class Rectangle : public Shape<Rectangle> {
    double w_, h_;
    friend class Shape<Rectangle>;

    double area_impl() const { return w_ * h_; }
    double perimeter_impl() const { return 2 * (w_ + h_); }
    void draw_impl() const { std::cout << "  rect " << w_ << "x" << h_ << "\n"; }
    const char* name() const { return "Rectangle"; }

public:
    Rectangle(double w, double h) : w_(w), h_(h) {}
};

// Compile-time polymorphism - no vtable, no indirection
template<typename ShapeT>
void process_shape(const Shape<ShapeT>& shape) {
    shape.draw();  // Statically dispatched
    std::cout << "  P/A ratio: " << shape.perimeter_to_area_ratio() << "\n";
}

int main() {
    Circle c(5.0);
    Rectangle r(3.0, 4.0);

    process_shape(c);   // Compiles to direct call Circle::area_impl()
    process_shape(r);   // Compiles to direct call Rectangle::area_impl()
    // Zero overhead - no vtable lookup at runtime
    return 0;
}
```

The `friend class Shape<Circle>` declaration inside `Circle` is necessary because `area_impl()`, `perimeter_impl()`, and friends are `private` - the CRTP base needs access to them. Without this, the `static_cast` in the base would fail to call the private methods. It's a small but important detail that often catches people the first time they write CRTP.

### Q2: Use CRTP as mixin classes to add reusable functionality

CRTP really shines as a mixin mechanism. You write one base class that adds a capability - say, an `operator!=` derived from `operator==`, or a `clone()` method, or an instance counter - and any derived class gets it for free by inheriting from the mixin. You can stack multiple mixins on a single class. The nice part is that each mixin is independently written and independently useful, so you're composing capabilities rather than forcing everything into a single inheritance hierarchy.

**Answer:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <type_traits>
#include <compare>

// CRTP Mixin 1: Equality operators
template<typename Derived>
class EqualityComparable {
public:
    friend bool operator!=(const Derived& a, const Derived& b) {
        return !(a == b);  // Derived must provide operator==
    }
};

// CRTP Mixin 2: Printable
template<typename Derived>
class Printable {
public:
    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const Derived& d) {
        d.print(os);       // Derived must provide print()
        return os;
    }

    std::string to_string() const {
        std::ostringstream oss;
        static_cast<const Derived*>(this)->print(oss);
        return oss.str();
    }
};

// CRTP Mixin 3: Clonable
template<typename Derived>
class Clonable {
public:
    std::unique_ptr<Derived> clone() const {
        return std::make_unique<Derived>(static_cast<const Derived&>(*this));
    }
};

// CRTP Mixin 4: Registry (counts instances)
template<typename Derived>
class InstanceCounter {
    static inline int count_ = 0;
public:
    InstanceCounter() { ++count_; }
    InstanceCounter(const InstanceCounter&) { ++count_; }
    ~InstanceCounter() { --count_; }
    static int instance_count() { return count_; }
};

// Compose multiple mixins
class Color : public EqualityComparable<Color>,
              public Printable<Color>,
              public Clonable<Color>,
              public InstanceCounter<Color> {
    uint8_t r_, g_, b_;

public:
    Color(uint8_t r, uint8_t g, uint8_t b) : r_(r), g_(g), b_(b) {}

    bool operator==(const Color& o) const {
        return r_ == o.r_ && g_ == o.g_ && b_ == o.b_;
    }

    void print(std::ostream& os) const {
        os << "RGB(" << (int)r_ << "," << (int)g_ << "," << (int)b_ << ")";
    }
};

int main() {
    Color red(255, 0, 0);
    Color blue(0, 0, 255);

    std::cout << red << "\n";           // RGB(255,0,0) - via Printable mixin
    std::cout << (red != blue) << "\n"; // 1 - via EqualityComparable mixin
    auto red2 = red.clone();            // unique_ptr<Color> - via Clonable mixin
    std::cout << Color::instance_count() << "\n";  // 3 - via InstanceCounter

    return 0;
}
```

Each mixin base has its own `static inline int count_` (for `InstanceCounter`) or its own hidden friend functions (for `EqualityComparable`, `Printable`). Because each mixin is `Base<Derived>` - a different instantiation for each derived class - the static member is separate per derived type. `InstanceCounter<Color>::count_` doesn't interfere with `InstanceCounter<Widget>::count_`. That per-type isolation is one of CRTP's most useful properties when building mixins.

### Q3: Show the CRTP vs virtual dispatch performance difference and C++23 deducing this

This example shows the performance story and also the future direction: C++23 introduces "deducing this," which lets you write the same pattern without the CRTP boilerplate. For new code targeting C++23, you can often replace CRTP entirely. The "deducing this" syntax is considerably more readable because you never have to write the `static_cast` or the template parameter on the base class.

**Answer:**

```cpp
// C++23: Deducing this replaces CRTP
// Before (CRTP):
template<typename Derived>
class OldPrintable {
public:
    void print() const {
        static_cast<const Derived*>(this)->do_print();
    }
};

class OldWidget : public OldPrintable<OldWidget> {
public:
    void do_print() const { std::cout << "Widget\n"; }
};

// After (C++23 deducing this - no CRTP needed!):
class NewPrintable {
public:
    void print(this const auto& self) {  // Deducing this
        self.do_print();                  // Calls derived method directly
    }
};

class NewWidget : public NewPrintable {
public:
    void do_print() const { std::cout << "Widget\n"; }
};
// No template parameter on the base class - much cleaner!

// Performance comparison
/*
Benchmark: 10M dispatch calls on x86_64

Virtual dispatch:

  - Indirect call through vtable pointer
  - ~2-5ns per call (cache miss: ~50ns)
  - Cannot be inlined by compiler

CRTP dispatch:

  - Direct function call (resolved at compile time)
  - ~0.3ns per call (always inlinable)
  - Compiler can optimize across call boundary

Typical results:
  Virtual:    35ms for 10M calls
  CRTP:       3ms for 10M calls  (10-12x faster)

When the difference matters:

  - Inner loops (physics sim, rendering, signal processing)
  - Embedded real-time (ISR, control loops)
  - Hot paths in high-frequency trading

When it DOESN'T matter:

  - Infrequent calls (UI buttons, config parsing)
  - IO-bound code (file, network)
  - Code where polymorphism is runtime-determined

*/
```

The "deducing this" syntax (`this const auto& self`) tells the compiler to deduce the actual type of `*this` - effectively the same thing CRTP achieves through the template parameter, but without any inheritance relationship involving templates. It's considerably more readable, and it doesn't lock you out of heterogeneous containers the way CRTP does.

---

## Notes

- CRTP has two real costs: longer compile times (more template instantiations) and harder-to-read error messages when something goes wrong.
- C++23 "deducing this" eliminates most CRTP use cases - prefer it when your compiler supports it.
- CRTP objects cannot be stored in a single heterogeneous container (unlike virtual polymorphism) - each `Shape<T>` is a distinct type with no common base that carries the interface. This is the fundamental trade-off.
- Use CRTP for tight loops, embedded systems, and performance-critical code where you've measured that vtable overhead matters; use virtual for extensible plugins and heterogeneous collections.
- The `friend class Shape<Circle>` declaration inside the derived class is needed to grant the CRTP base access to the private `_impl` methods.
