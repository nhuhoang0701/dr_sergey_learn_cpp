## Notes

- Monadic chaining with `std::optional::and_then` / `std::expected::and_then` (C++23) enables composable error handling without manual error-check boilerplate.
- Pure functions (no side effects, same input -> same output) are easier to test and parallelize - C++ doesn't enforce purity but you can follow the discipline.
- `std::variant` + `std::visit` implements algebraic data types (sum types) in C++, with exhaustive compile-time case checking.
- Expression templates defer computation to a single pass - used in linear algebra libraries like Eigen and Blaze to eliminate temporary objects.
- Persistent (immutable) data structures share unchanged parts between versions, making them efficient for undo/version history and safe for concurrent access.
- Railway-oriented programming chains operations that may fail, short-circuiting on the first error and carrying it to the end of the pipeline.
- `std::views` pipelines (C++20) provide lazy functional transformations over ranges with no intermediate allocations.
- Continuation-passing style (CPS) maps naturally to coroutines and the sender/receiver pattern - coroutines are essentially syntactic sugar for CPS.
- Pattern matching proposals (C++26) aim to add `inspect` expressions for functional-style dispatch, replacing the `overloaded` helper trick.
- Avoid mutable shared state - this is the core principle of functional programming and applies directly to concurrent C++ to avoid data races.
