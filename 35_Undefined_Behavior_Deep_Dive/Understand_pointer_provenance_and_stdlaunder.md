## Topic Overview

Pointer provenance is the concept that a pointer carries invisible metadata about **which object it was derived from**. The compiler uses this provenance information to perform optimizations: if a pointer was obtained from object A, the compiler assumes it cannot access object B, even if A and B happen to occupy the same memory address.

This becomes critical in two scenarios:

1. **Placement new** over an existing object: the old pointer's provenance points to the destroyed object, not the new one
2. **`const` or reference members**: the compiler may cache values through the old pointer, not knowing the object was replaced

`std::launder` (C++17) is a "provenance barrier"—it takes a pointer whose provenance is outdated and returns a new pointer with correct provenance to the object currently living at that address.

| Scenario | Provenance Issue | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Placement new, no const/ref members | Compiler may cache old object's values | `std::launder` or use returned pointer |
| Placement new over `const` member | Compiler assumes `const` member unchanged | `std::launder` required |
| Placement new over reference member | Reference target assumed stable | `std::launder` required |
| `reinterpret_cast` round-trip | May lose provenance through cast chain | `std::launder` restores it |
| Aligned storage + placement new | Original storage has no object provenance | Use returned pointer from `new` |

```cpp

Step 1: Object A lives at address 0x1000
        ptr → Object A (provenance: A)

Step 2: Placement new creates Object B at 0x1000
        ptr still has provenance: A (stale!)
        Compiler may optimize as if A still exists.

Step 3: std::launder(ptr) → new_ptr
        new_ptr has provenance: B (correct!)
        Compiler now sees the current object.

```

`std::launder` does NOT change the pointer value—it returns the same address. It is a compile-time directive that tells the optimizer to discard cached assumptions about what lives at that address.

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Show why placement new over an object with const members requires std::launder

```cpp

#include <cstdio>
#include <memory>
#include <new>

struct Widget {
    const int id;     // const member — compiler may cache this
    double value;

    Widget(int i, double v) : id(i), value(v) {}
};

void demonstrate_provenance_issue() {
    // Allocate aligned storage
    alignas(Widget) unsigned char buf[sizeof(Widget)];

    // Construct Widget with id=1
    Widget* w1 = new (buf) Widget(1, 3.14);
    std::printf("Original: id=%d, value=%.2f\n", w1->id, w1->value);

    // Destroy and reconstruct with id=2
    w1->~Widget();
    Widget* w2 = new (buf) Widget(2, 2.71);

    // BUG: using w1 after placement new
    // The compiler may assume w1->id is still 1 (const member → cached)
    // std::printf("Via old ptr: id=%d\n", w1->id);  // UB!

    // CORRECT: use the pointer returned by placement new
    std::printf("Via new ptr: id=%d, value=%.2f\n", w2->id, w2->value);

    // Alternative: std::launder refreshes provenance
    Widget* w3 = std::launder(reinterpret_cast<Widget*>(buf));
    std::printf("Via launder: id=%d, value=%.2f\n", w3->id, w3->value);

    w2->~Widget();  // Clean up
}

// Why does the compiler cache const members?
// Because the standard says modifying a const object is UB.
// If w1->id is const and w1 points to a Widget, the compiler
// is allowed to assume w1->id never changes for the lifetime of *w1.
// Placement new creates a NEW object, but w1's provenance
// still refers to the OLD object whose const member was 1.

int main() {
    demonstrate_provenance_issue();
}

```

**Answer:** When a `const` member exists, the compiler may cache its value through any pointer that was obtained from the original object. After placement new creates a new object at the same address, the old pointer's provenance refers to the destroyed object. `std::launder` or the pointer returned by `new` must be used to access the new object.

### Q2: Demonstrate std::launder with reference members and array storage

```cpp

#include <cassert>
#include <cstdio>
#include <new>

struct RefHolder {
    int& ref;
    int data;

    RefHolder(int& r, int d) : ref(r), data(d) {}
};

void reference_member_provenance() {
    int target_a = 10;
    int target_b = 20;

    alignas(RefHolder) unsigned char buf[sizeof(RefHolder)];

    // Construct with reference to target_a
    RefHolder* h1 = new (buf) RefHolder(target_a, 100);
    std::printf("h1: ref=%d, data=%d\n", h1->ref, h1->data);

    h1->~RefHolder();

    // Reconstruct with reference to target_b
    RefHolder* h2 = new (buf) RefHolder(target_b, 200);

    // Using h1 here is UB: the reference member changed,
    // but h1's provenance refers to the old object.
    // The compiler may assume h1->ref still refers to target_a.

    // CORRECT: use h2 or std::launder
    std::printf("h2: ref=%d, data=%d\n", h2->ref, h2->data);

    RefHolder* h3 = std::launder(reinterpret_cast<RefHolder*>(buf));
    std::printf("h3: ref=%d, data=%d\n", h3->ref, h3->data);

    h2->~RefHolder();
}

// Array placement new and provenance
void array_provenance() {
    // When using aligned storage for arrays, be careful with indexing.
    alignas(int) unsigned char buf[sizeof(int) * 4];

    // Construct 4 ints
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
        new (buf + i * sizeof(int)) int(i * 10);
    }

    // Access via pointer arithmetic on the storage
    // This requires std::launder because buf's provenance
    // is unsigned char[], not int[].
    int* arr = std::launder(reinterpret_cast<int*>(buf));

    // Note: pointer arithmetic on arr is only valid if the ints
    // form an array. Individual placement new does NOT create an array.
    // arr[0] is OK (points to the first int).
    // arr[1] is technically UB — no array object exists!

    // Safe approach: use std::array or construct a real array
    std::printf("arr[0] = %d\n", *std::launder(reinterpret_cast<int*>(buf)));
    std::printf("arr[1] = %d\n",
                *std::launder(reinterpret_cast<int*>(buf + sizeof(int))));
}

// C++23 alternative: std::start_lifetime_as_array
// auto* arr = std::start_lifetime_as_array<int>(buf, 4);
// This implicitly creates the array object, making pointer arithmetic legal.

int main() {
    reference_member_provenance();
    array_provenance();
}

```

**Answer:** Reference members have the same provenance issue as `const` members—the compiler assumes the reference target doesn't change. Additionally, individual placement `new` calls do not create an array object, so pointer arithmetic between them is UB. `std::launder` fixes provenance for individual elements; `std::start_lifetime_as_array` (C++23) creates a proper array.

### Q3: Explain when std::launder is NOT needed and common misuses

```cpp

#include <cstdio>
#include <memory>
#include <new>
#include <vector>

struct Simple {
    int x;
    double y;

    Simple(int a, double b) : x(a), y(b) {}
};

void launder_not_needed() {
    // Case 1: Using the pointer returned by placement new — launder NOT needed
    alignas(Simple) unsigned char buf[sizeof(Simple)];
    Simple* s = new (buf) Simple(1, 2.0);
    // s is already the correct pointer with proper provenance.
    std::printf("x=%d, y=%.1f\n", s->x, s->y);
    s->~Simple();

    // Case 2: No const or reference members, reusing same pointer
    Simple* s2 = new (buf) Simple(3, 4.0);
    // Accessing through s2 is fine — it's the returned pointer.
    std::printf("x=%d, y=%.1f\n", s2->x, s2->y);
    s2->~Simple();

    // Case 3: Regular new/delete — launder never needed
    Simple* heap = new Simple(5, 6.0);
    std::printf("x=%d, y=%.1f\n", heap->x, heap->y);
    delete heap;

    // Case 4: Containers manage provenance internally
    std::vector<Simple> vec;
    vec.emplace_back(7, 8.0);
    // vector handles placement new and provenance correctly.
}

void launder_IS_needed() {
    // Case 1: Replacing an object with const members
    struct ConstMember {
        const int id;
        int value;
    };

    alignas(ConstMember) unsigned char buf[sizeof(ConstMember)];
    auto* c1 = new (buf) ConstMember{1, 100};
    c1->~ConstMember();
    new (buf) ConstMember{2, 200};

    // Must launder to access the new object through the buffer
    auto* c2 = std::launder(reinterpret_cast<ConstMember*>(buf));
    std::printf("New id=%d\n", c2->id);
    c2->~ConstMember();

    // Case 2: Type-erased storage in custom containers
    // When you store objects in aligned_storage/byte arrays and
    // retrieve them via reinterpret_cast, std::launder is needed.
}

// Common MISUSES of std::launder:

// WRONG: using launder to "fix" strict aliasing violations
// float f = 3.14f;
// int* p = std::launder(reinterpret_cast<int*>(&f));
// int bits = *p;  // STILL UB — launder does not override aliasing rules!

// WRONG: using launder on a pointer to memory where no object exists
// unsigned char buf[sizeof(int)];
// int* p = std::launder(reinterpret_cast<int*>(buf));
// int val = *p;  // UB — no int object has been created in buf!

// launder ONLY works when a valid object of the target type
// already exists at the address. It updates provenance, not type.

int main() {
    launder_not_needed();
    launder_IS_needed();
}

```

**Answer:** `std::launder` is needed only when (1) an object has been replaced via placement new, AND (2) you access it through a pointer that predates the replacement, AND (3) the type has `const`/reference members or you're accessing through a reinterpreted buffer pointer. It is NOT a "cast fix"—it does not override strict aliasing, and it requires a valid object to already exist at the address.

## Notes

- `std::launder` was introduced in C++17 largely to formalize what `std::optional` and `std::variant` implementations need to do internally.
- The pointer provenance model is being formalized in both C (PNVI-ae-UD model) and C++ (P2318).
- `std::launder` is a no-op at runtime—it compiles to nothing. Its effect is purely on the optimizer's alias analysis.
- In C++23, `std::start_lifetime_as<T>` subsumes many use cases of `std::launder` by implicitly creating the object.
- When implementing type-erased storage (like `std::any`), `std::launder` is essential for correctness when retrieving stored objects.
- Compilers are increasingly strict about provenance in their optimizers; code that "worked" without `std::launder` may break with newer compiler versions.
