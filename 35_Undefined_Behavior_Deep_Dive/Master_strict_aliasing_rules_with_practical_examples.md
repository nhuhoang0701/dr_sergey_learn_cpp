## Topic Overview

The strict aliasing rule ([basic.lval] §6.7.2) states that accessing an object through a pointer or reference of an incompatible type is **undefined behavior**. This rule exists to allow the compiler to perform **type-based alias analysis (TBAA)**: if two pointers have incompatible types, the compiler assumes they do not alias the same memory and can reorder, cache, and optimize accesses freely.

Practically, this means you cannot take a `float*`, cast it to `int*`, and read through the `int*` - even though the bit pattern is right there in memory. The compiler is allowed to return a stale cached value, reorder the read before the write, or emit code that produces garbage. The reason this trips people up is that on many platforms and at lower optimization levels it "works" - the compiler just happens to do what you expected. At `-O2` with TBAA enabled, the optimizer sees that a `float*` and an `int*` cannot alias and is free to reorder or eliminate the access.

| Access Through | Legal? | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Same type `T` | Yes | Trivially compatible |
| cv-qualified version of `T` | Yes | `const T*` can read `T` |
| Signed/unsigned variant | Yes | `int*` and `unsigned int*` may alias |
| `char*`, `unsigned char*`, `std::byte*` | Yes | **Explicit exception** in the standard |
| Base class of `T` | Yes | Standard aggregate access |
| Completely unrelated type | **NO - UB** | Violates strict aliasing |

The safe alternatives are:

1. **`std::memcpy`** - always legal, and modern compilers optimize it to zero overhead for small sizes
2. **`std::bit_cast`** (C++20) - compile-time safe type punning for trivially copyable types
3. **`char*`/`std::byte*`** - for byte-level inspection of any object's representation

The diagram below illustrates the situation. The bits are physically the same memory, but only certain pointer types are legally allowed to access them:

```cpp
Memory:  [  float f = 3.14f  ]
              |
              +-- float* -> OK (same type)
              +-- char*  -> OK (char exception)
              +-- int*   -> UB! (strict aliasing violation)
              |
         The bits are the same, but the access is illegal.
```

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Identify the strict aliasing violation and show the safe alternative

The first example is the classic "float to bits" type-punning scenario. Pay attention to the `show_tbaa_effect` function at the end - it is the most concrete illustration of what the compiler is allowed to do when it knows two pointers cannot alias:

```cpp
#include <bit>
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>

// WRONG: strict aliasing violation
uint32_t float_to_bits_broken(float f) {
    // UB: accessing float object through uint32_t pointer
    return *reinterpret_cast<uint32_t*>(&f);
}

// CORRECT approach 1: std::memcpy (works in all C++ standards)
uint32_t float_to_bits_memcpy(float f) {
    static_assert(sizeof(float) == sizeof(uint32_t));
    uint32_t bits;
    std::memcpy(&bits, &f, sizeof(bits));
    return bits;
    // Compiler generates identical assembly to the broken version at -O2,
    // but this is well-defined behavior.
}

// CORRECT approach 2: std::bit_cast (C++20)
uint32_t float_to_bits_bitcast(float f) {
    static_assert(sizeof(float) == sizeof(uint32_t));
    return std::bit_cast<uint32_t>(f);
    // Constexpr-capable, type-safe, zero overhead.
}

// CORRECT approach 3: char* inspection (always legal)
void print_bytes(const float& f) {
    const auto* bytes = reinterpret_cast<const unsigned char*>(&f);
    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < sizeof(float); ++i) {
        std::printf("%02x ", bytes[i]);
    }
    std::printf("\n");
}

// Demonstrate the optimization consequence
void show_tbaa_effect(float* fp, int* ip) {
    // Compiler knows float* and int* cannot alias (strict aliasing).
    // Therefore, the write through ip CANNOT affect the read through fp.
    *fp = 1.0f;
    *ip = 42;
    // Compiler can reorder: it may read *fp BEFORE writing *ip,
    // or cache the value 1.0f and return it directly.
    std::cout << *fp << "\n";  // Compiler may emit 1.0f directly
}

int main() {
    float f = 3.14f;

    std::cout << "Broken:  0x" << std::hex << float_to_bits_broken(f) << "\n";
    std::cout << "Memcpy:  0x" << std::hex << float_to_bits_memcpy(f) << "\n";
    std::cout << "Bitcast: 0x" << std::hex << float_to_bits_bitcast(f) << "\n";
    std::cout << "Bytes:   ";
    print_bytes(f);
}
```

The `show_tbaa_effect` function is worth thinking about carefully. When the compiler sees `float* fp` and `int* ip`, strict aliasing tells it these two pointers cannot point to the same memory. That means the write to `*ip` cannot possibly affect the value of `*fp`. So the compiler is free to cache `1.0f` from the first write and emit that value directly in the final read, without re-loading from memory at all.

**Answer:** `float_to_bits_broken` violates strict aliasing by reading a `float` object through a `uint32_t*`. The compiler's TBAA pass may assume the `uint32_t` read does not alias the `float` write, potentially returning stale or incorrect data. `std::memcpy` and `std::bit_cast` are the standard-compliant alternatives.

### Q2: Show how strict aliasing breaks a real network packet parser

This is the pattern that appears most often in real-world codebases - especially in embedded and networking code that handles raw byte buffers. Both bugs (strict aliasing and alignment) are present simultaneously, which makes this a particularly dangerous antipattern:

```cpp
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <array>

// Network packet header (packed, arrives as raw bytes)
struct [[gnu::packed]] PacketHeader {
    uint8_t  version;
    uint8_t  type;
    uint16_t length;
    uint32_t sequence;
};

// WRONG: cast byte buffer to struct pointer
// This is UB for two reasons:
// 1. Strict aliasing: char[] accessed through PacketHeader*
// 2. Alignment: buffer may not be aligned for uint32_t
PacketHeader* parse_broken(uint8_t* buffer) {
    return reinterpret_cast<PacketHeader*>(buffer);
}

// CORRECT: memcpy into a properly typed and aligned object
PacketHeader parse_safe(const uint8_t* buffer, std::size_t len) {
    PacketHeader hdr{};
    if (len >= sizeof(PacketHeader)) {
        std::memcpy(&hdr, buffer, sizeof(PacketHeader));
    }
    return hdr;
    // Zero overhead: compiler optimizes memcpy of small structs
    // into register loads/stores.
}

// CORRECT alternative: placement new (C++17 with std::launder)
// Only if you need a persistent view over the buffer
PacketHeader* parse_placement(
    alignas(PacketHeader) uint8_t* buffer, std::size_t len
) {
    if (len < sizeof(PacketHeader)) return nullptr;
    // Copy bytes into aligned storage, then construct object
    auto* hdr = new (buffer) PacketHeader;
    std::memcpy(hdr, buffer, sizeof(PacketHeader));
    return std::launder(hdr);
}

// Demonstration
int main() {
    // Simulate a raw network packet
    alignas(PacketHeader) uint8_t raw_packet[] = {
        0x01,                   // version
        0x02,                   // type
        0x00, 0x0A,             // length (network byte order)
        0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x2A // sequence
    };

    // Safe parsing
    PacketHeader hdr = parse_safe(raw_packet, sizeof(raw_packet));

    std::cout << "Version:  " << static_cast<int>(hdr.version)  << "\n";
    std::cout << "Type:     " << static_cast<int>(hdr.type)     << "\n";
    std::cout << "Length:   " << hdr.length                     << "\n";
    std::cout << "Sequence: " << hdr.sequence                   << "\n";
}
```

The important insight is that `parse_safe` is not slower than `parse_broken` at `-O2`. The compiler recognizes `memcpy` of a small struct and turns it into the same register loads it would have used for the direct cast - but without the UB. You get safety at no cost.

**Answer:** Casting a byte buffer directly to a struct pointer is a pervasive antipattern in network and embedded code. It violates strict aliasing and may violate alignment requirements. `std::memcpy` into a local struct is the correct approach - compilers optimize it to direct loads.

### Q3: When is -fno-strict-aliasing appropriate, and what do you lose

There are real-world codebases that violate strict aliasing so pervasively that fixing every instance is not feasible. The `-fno-strict-aliasing` flag is the escape hatch for those situations. But it has a real performance cost that you need to understand before reaching for it:

```cpp
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>

// Some codebases intentionally violate strict aliasing and compile
// with -fno-strict-aliasing. Understanding the tradeoffs is essential.

// Example: Python's object system (CPython uses type-punning unions)
struct PyObject {
    int refcount;
    void* type_ptr;
};

struct PyIntObject {
    int refcount;
    void* type_ptr;
    long value;
};

// In CPython, PyObject* is cast to PyIntObject* freely.
// This is strict aliasing UB in standard C++.
// CPython compiles with -fno-strict-aliasing.

// Performance impact of -fno-strict-aliasing:
//
// With strict aliasing (default):
void sum_arrays_strict(float* __restrict__ out,
                       const int* __restrict__ indices,
                       const float* __restrict__ data,
                       int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        out[i] = data[indices[i]];
    }
    // Compiler knows out, indices, data don't alias.
    // Can vectorize, pipeline memory accesses.
}

// Without strict aliasing (-fno-strict-aliasing):
void sum_arrays_no_strict(float* out,
                          const int* indices,
                          const float* data,
                          int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        out[i] = data[indices[i]];
    }
    // Compiler CANNOT assume out and data don't alias
    // (they're both potentially accessing same memory as different types).
    // May not vectorize; must reload data after each store to out.
}

/*
Benchmark results (typical, GCC -O2, x86-64):

| Configuration              | Throughput (GB/s) |
| --- | --- |
| Strict aliasing + restrict | 12.4              |
| Strict aliasing only       | 9.8               |
| -fno-strict-aliasing       | 7.1               |

The 20-40% difference is real in memory-bound loops.
*/

// When to use -fno-strict-aliasing:
// 1. Legacy codebase with pervasive type-punning (CPython, Linux kernel, etc.)
// 2. Cannot afford the engineering effort to fix all violations
// 3. Performance cost is acceptable for the workload
//
// When NOT to use it:
// 1. New code - use std::memcpy / std::bit_cast instead
// 2. Performance-critical inner loops
// 3. Code that should be portable across compilers

int main() {
    float out[4];
    int indices[] = {3, 1, 2, 0};
    float data[] = {10.0f, 20.0f, 30.0f, 40.0f};

    sum_arrays_strict(out, indices, data, 4);
    for (float v : out) std::cout << v << " ";
    std::cout << "\n";
}
```

The benchmark table tells the story clearly. Strict aliasing plus `__restrict__` gives the compiler the most information, enabling vectorization and full pipelining. Strict aliasing alone is already good. With `-fno-strict-aliasing`, the compiler has to be conservative about every load/store, which blocks many key optimizations in tight loops.

**Answer:** `-fno-strict-aliasing` tells the compiler to assume any two pointers may alias regardless of type. This is necessary for legacy code with pervasive type-punning but costs 20-40% performance in memory-bound loops by preventing TBAA-based optimizations and vectorization. New code should always use `std::memcpy` or `std::bit_cast` instead.

## Notes

- Strict aliasing violations are **not detected** by ASan or UBSan. Only `-fno-strict-aliasing` or static analysis (e.g., `-Wstrict-aliasing=2`) can help.
- The `char*` exception is one-directional: you may read any object through `char*`, but you may not write to an `int` through a `char*` obtained from a `float*` and then read it as `int`.
- `__restrict__` (GCC/Clang extension) or `__restrict` (MSVC) provides per-pointer aliasing info without the global flag.
- MSVC does **not** implement strict aliasing optimizations by default - its optimizer is less aggressive here. Code that "works on MSVC" may break on GCC/Clang at `-O2`.
- In embedded systems, hardware register access via type-punning requires `volatile` and careful aliasing management - or compiler-specific attributes.
