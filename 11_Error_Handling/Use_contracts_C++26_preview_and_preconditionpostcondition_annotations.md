## Topic Overview

**C++26 contracts** introduce standardized syntax for **preconditions**, **postconditions**, and **assertions** directly in function declarations. Unlike `assert()`, contracts are part of the type system - they are visible in declarations, can be read by IDEs and static analyzers, and have configurable runtime behavior that goes beyond a simple on/off switch.

### Contract Syntax (C++26)

The syntax attaches conditions to the function signature rather than burying them in the body. A `pre` clause appears before the opening brace and is checked before the body runs. A `post` clause introduces a name for the return value and checks it after the function returns. A `contract_assert` lives inside the body like a normal assertion:

```cpp
// Precondition: checked before function body executes
int sqrt_int(int x)
    pre(x >= 0)           // precondition
    post(r: r >= 0)       // postcondition: 'r' names the return value
{
    contract_assert(x < 1000000);  // assertion within function body
    return /* implementation */;
}

// Multiple conditions
void copy(const char* src, char* dst, size_t n)
    pre(src != nullptr)
    pre(dst != nullptr)
    pre(n > 0)
    post(dst[0] == src[0])  // first byte copied correctly
{
    // ...
}
```

The reason `post(r: expr)` uses that unusual `r:` notation is that you need a name to refer to the return value in the condition - and the return value does not have a name in the function body the way parameters do.

### Three Contract Annotation Types

| Annotation | Where | Checks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pre(expr)` | Function declaration | Caller's obligation (before call) |
| `post(r: expr)` | Function declaration | Function's guarantee (after return) |
| `contract_assert(expr)` | Function body | Invariant within function |

### Contract Violation Modes

The contract evaluation semantic is set globally at build time (not per-contract). This gives you a single dial to turn for the whole build, which keeps things predictable - you cannot accidentally have some contracts enforced and others ignored in the same binary.

| Mode | Behavior on Violation | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ignore** | No check generated (contracts removed entirely) | Maximum performance (release build) |
| **observe** | Check runs; on violation, calls handler but **continues** | Gradual adoption / logging |
| **enforce** | Check runs; on violation, calls handler and **does not continue** | Debug / testing |

```cpp
// Build modes:
//   -fcontract-semantic=ignore    ->  zero runtime cost (like NDEBUG for assert)
//   -fcontract-semantic=observe   ->  log violations but don't crash
//   -fcontract-semantic=enforce   ->  crash on violation (like assert)
```

The "observe" mode is particularly interesting - it lets you deploy contracts into a production system to find violations before you commit to hard enforcement. You collect logs, fix the callers that are violating preconditions, and then switch to "enforce" once you are confident the code is clean.

### Important Notes

- Contracts are evaluated in the **caller's context** (for `pre`/`post`) - they can be part of the ABI.
- The `post(r: expr)` syntax names the return value as `r` (or any identifier).
- Contract conditions must not have side effects (implementation may evaluate them zero or more times).
- C++26 contracts are **not yet available** in any major compiler (as of 2024). Use `assert()` or custom macros as a bridge.

## Self-Assessment

### Q1: Write a function with `pre(x > 0)` and `post(result >= 0)` annotations

Here are several functions with contracts, followed by the `assert()`-based equivalent you should use until C++26 compilers ship. Notice how the C++26 syntax makes the function's API promises visible directly in the declaration - you do not have to open the implementation to understand what the caller must provide and what the function guarantees.

**Solution - C++26 Contracts Syntax:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <cassert>

// ========== C++26 contracts (when available) ==========

// Square root with contracts
double safe_sqrt(double x)
    pre(x >= 0.0)             // caller must ensure non-negative input
    post(r: r >= 0.0)         // function guarantees non-negative result
    post(r: std::abs(r * r - x) < 0.0001)  // result is approximately correct
{
    return std::sqrt(x);
}

// Binary search with contracts
int binary_search(const int* arr, int n, int target)
    pre(arr != nullptr)       // non-null array
    pre(n > 0)                // non-empty
    // pre: arr is sorted (can't easily express in a single expression)
    post(r: r == -1 || (r >= 0 && r < n))  // valid index or -1
{
    int lo = 0, hi = n - 1;
    while (lo <= hi) {
        int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == target) return mid;
        if (arr[mid] < target) lo = mid + 1;
        else hi = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1;
}

// Division with multiple preconditions
double safe_divide(double a, double b)
    pre(b != 0.0)                    // no division by zero
    pre(!std::isnan(a))              // valid inputs
    pre(!std::isnan(b))
    post(r: !std::isnan(r))          // valid output
{
    return a / b;
}

// ========== Today's equivalent with assert() ==========
// (Use until C++26 compilers ship)

double safe_sqrt_today(double x) {
    assert(x >= 0.0 && "Precondition: x must be non-negative");
    double result = std::sqrt(x);
    assert(result >= 0.0 && "Postcondition: result must be non-negative");
    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << safe_sqrt_today(25.0) << "\n";   // 5
    std::cout << safe_sqrt_today(0.0) << "\n";    // 0

    // This would trigger the precondition:
    // std::cout << safe_sqrt_today(-1.0) << "\n";  // assertion failure!
}
// Expected output:
//   5
//   0
```

**Key Syntax Details:**

- `pre(expression)` - evaluated before the function body.
- `post(r: expression)` - `r` is the return value; evaluated after the function returns.
- `contract_assert(expression)` - checked at that point in the function body.
- Multiple `pre`/`post` clauses are allowed - all are checked.

### Q2: Explain the three contract violation modes: ignore, observe, enforce

The three modes give you a progression from "development" to "production" without ever removing the contract annotations from your source code. This is a significant improvement over plain `assert()`, which gives you only on and off.

**Complete Explanation:**

The flow diagram below shows exactly how the mode affects execution when a contract is evaluated:

```cpp
// Contract Check Point
//   pre(x > 0)
//        |
//   Is mode "ignore"?
//   +----+----+
//  YES        NO
//   |          |
// (no check)  Evaluate expression
//   |          |
// Continue   Expression true?
// execution  +----+----+
//           YES        NO (violation!)
//            |          |
//       Continue    Is mode "observe"?
//       execution   +----+----+
//                  YES        NO (enforce)
//                   |          |
//             Call handler   Call handler
//             Continue!      DO NOT continue
//                             (terminate)
```

**Detailed Comparison:**

| Aspect | `ignore` | `observe` | `enforce` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Expression evaluated? | No | Yes | Yes |
| On violation: handler called? | No | Yes | Yes |
| On violation: continues? | N/A | **Yes** (handler returns) | **No** (handler must not return) |
| Runtime cost | Zero | Check cost + handler cost | Check cost |
| Use case | Shipped release builds | Migration / logging | Development / testing |
| Analogy | `NDEBUG` + `assert()` | Logging middleware | `assert()` in debug |

**Migration Strategy:**

The recommended adoption path takes you through all three modes in order:

```cpp
// Phase 1: Add contracts in "observe" mode
//   -> Find all violations in production logs
//   -> Fix them without breaking existing behavior
//   -> No crashes - just logging

// Phase 2: Switch to "enforce" mode in CI/testing
//   -> All tests must pass with contracts enforced
//   -> Catches bugs early in development

// Phase 3: Ship with "ignore" or "enforce" per preference
//   -> "ignore": maximum performance
//   -> "enforce": maximum safety
```

This migration path is one of the strongest advantages contracts have over plain `assert()`. You cannot gradually adopt `assert()` in a production system - it either crashes or is silent. Contracts let you start with observation.

**Custom Contract Violation Handler (C++26):**

```cpp
// The default handler calls std::terminate().
// You can install a custom handler:

void my_contract_handler(const std::contract_violation& v) {
    std::cerr << "Contract violated!\n"
              << "  Kind: " << (v.kind() == std::contract_kind::pre ? "pre" :
                                v.kind() == std::contract_kind::post ? "post" : "assert")
              << "\n"
              << "  Location: " << v.location().file_name()
              << ":" << v.location().line() << "\n"
              << "  Comment: " << v.comment() << "\n";
    // In "observe" mode, returning from here continues execution
    // In "enforce" mode, returning has undefined behavior
}
```

Note the important asymmetry: in "observe" mode you can return from the handler and execution continues. In "enforce" mode, returning from the handler is undefined behavior - you must call `std::terminate()` or `std::abort()`.

### Q3: Compare contracts with `assert()` and explain the advantages for production builds

The headline advantage is that contracts are part of the function's interface - visible in header files, readable by tools, and expressible in terms of the return value. Plain `assert()` is an implementation detail buried in the body.

**Head-to-Head Comparison:**

| Feature | `assert()` | C++26 Contracts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Syntax location** | Inside function body | On function **declaration** |
| **Visible to caller?** | No (implementation detail) | **Yes** - part of the interface |
| **Postconditions?** | Manual (check before return) | Built-in `post(r: expr)` |
| **Build modes** | Binary: on/off (`NDEBUG`) | Three: ignore/observe/enforce |
| **Gradual adoption** | No "log but continue" mode | **observe** mode enables logging |
| **Side effects** | Expression may have side effects | Must be side-effect-free |
| **Optimizer hints** | None | **ignore** mode may use as `[[assume]]` |
| **Tooling** | No special support | IDE/analyzer can read contracts from headers |
| **Virtual functions** | N/A | Contracts on base apply to overrides |
| **Standard?** | C-era macro | C++26 language feature |

**The Key Advantages for Production:**

```cpp
// 1. OBSERVE mode: log violations WITHOUT crashing
//    assert():     NDEBUG removes all checks -> silent bugs in production
//    Contracts:    observe mode LOGS the violation and continues

// 2. Optimizer hints: in "ignore" mode, the compiler can ASSUME the
//    contract holds -> better optimization than assert+NDEBUG
double fast_sqrt(double x)
    pre(x >= 0.0)   // in "ignore" mode: optimizer assumes x >= 0
{
    return __builtin_sqrt(x);  // no need for NaN check
}

// 3. Declaration-level visibility: contracts are API documentation
//    that the compiler can verify
// In header file:
int find(const std::vector<int>& v, int target)
    pre(!v.empty())            // caller sees this in the declaration
    post(r: r == -1 || r < static_cast<int>(v.size()));

// 4. Virtual function contracts: base class contracts apply to overrides
class Shape {
public:
    virtual double area() const
        post(r: r >= 0.0) = 0;  // all implementations must return non-negative
};
```

The virtual function case is especially powerful. Today, if you have a base class with an `area()` method and you want every override to return a non-negative value, you can only document that in a comment. With contracts, the compiler enforces it.

**Today's Bridge: Custom Macro:**

Until C++26 is available, you can write a macro that mimics the three-mode behavior. It is more verbose than contracts but gives you the same "observe vs enforce vs ignore" flexibility right now:

```cpp
// Until C++26 is available, use a custom macro that
// mimics the three-mode behavior:

#if defined(CONTRACT_OBSERVE)
#define PRE(expr) \
    if (!(expr)) { \
        std::cerr << "PRE violation: " #expr " at " \
                  << __FILE__ << ":" << __LINE__ << "\n"; \
    }
#elif defined(CONTRACT_ENFORCE)
#define PRE(expr) \
    if (!(expr)) { \
        std::cerr << "PRE violation: " #expr " at " \
                  << __FILE__ << ":" << __LINE__ << "\n"; \
        std::abort(); \
    }
#else  // CONTRACT_IGNORE
#define PRE(expr) ((void)0)
#endif

double safe_sqrt(double x) {
    PRE(x >= 0.0);
    return std::sqrt(x);
}
```

This gets you most of the runtime behavior of contracts today. The things you miss are the declaration-level visibility, the `post` syntax, virtual function enforcement, and optimizer integration - but for the basic "check and log" use case, it works.

## Notes

- **C++26 contracts are not yet implemented** by GCC, Clang, or MSVC (as of 2024). The feature was voted into C++26 working draft (P2900).
- **Contracts replace P0542/P1429** - earlier contract proposals that were removed from C++20 at the last minute.
- **`[[assume(expr)]]`** (C++23) is a related but different feature - it tells the optimizer to assume `expr` is true (UB if false). Contracts are checked; assumes are not.
- **GSL `Expects()`/`Ensures()`** (Microsoft Guidelines Support Library) are widely used as contract-like macros today.
- **Contract conditions should be fast** - avoid O(n) checks in preconditions of O(1) functions. Expensive checks like "array is sorted" should be debug-only.
- **Thread safety:** Contract evaluation happens in the calling thread's context, before/after the function's body executes.
