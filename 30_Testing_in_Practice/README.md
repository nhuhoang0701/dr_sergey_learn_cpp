## Notes

- Write tests before or alongside code - testing after the fact often misses edge cases.
- Test behavior, not implementation - tests should survive refactoring.
- Use fixtures (SetUp/TearDown) to share expensive setup between related tests.
- Parameterized tests (TEST_P) reduce duplication when testing the same logic with different inputs.
- Test names should describe the scenario and expected outcome - ThrowsOnNullInput, not Test1.
- Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern structures each test clearly.
- Test error paths as thoroughly as success paths - most bugs hide in edge cases.
- Keep unit tests fast (under 1ms each) - slow tests discourage running them frequently.
- Death tests (EXPECT_DEATH) verify that code correctly terminates on invalid input.
- Use CI to run tests on every commit - broken tests should block merging.
