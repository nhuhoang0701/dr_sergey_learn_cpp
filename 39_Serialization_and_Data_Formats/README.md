# Serialization & Data Formats

## Notes

- Protocol Buffers (protobuf) provide schema-evolving binary serialization with cross-language support
- FlatBuffers enable zero-copy access — no deserialization step, ideal for performance-critical paths
- JSON libraries (nlohmann/json, simdjson, glaze) range from convenience to raw speed
- Cap'n Proto provides zero-copy like FlatBuffers but with an RPC framework built in
- std::bit_cast (C++20) is the safe way to type-pun for binary serialization of trivial types
- MessagePack is a compact binary alternative to JSON — smaller payloads, faster parsing
- Schema validation should happen at system boundaries — not on every internal access
- Endianness must be handled for binary formats — use network byte order or explicit conversion
- Versioning and backward compatibility should be designed from the start (field numbers, optional fields)
- Reflection (C++26) will eventually enable automatic serialization without boilerplate
